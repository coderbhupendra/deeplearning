no , it was n't black monday .
but while the new york stock exchange did n't fall apart friday as the dow jones industrial average plunged unk points -- most of it in the final hour -- it barely managed to stay this side of chaos .
some `` circuit breakers '' installed after the october 1987 crash failed their first test , traders say , unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures . the 49 stock specialist firms on the big board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the 1987 crash -- once again could n't handle the selling pressure .
big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock , traders say . heavy selling of standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures in chicago unk beat stocks downward .
seven big board stocks -- ual , amr , bankamerica , walt disney , capital cities\/abc , philip morris and pacific telesis group -- stopped trading and never resumed .
the unk has already begun . `` the equity market was unk . once again { the specialists } were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the new york stock exchange , '' said christopher unk , senior vice president at unk securities corp .
unk james unk , chairman of specialists henderson brothers inc. : `` it is easy to say the specialist is n't doing his job . when the dollar is in a unk , even central banks ca n't stop it . speculators are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market . ''
many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early friday afternoon on a warm autumn day -- because the stock market was so quiet . then in a unk plunge , the dow jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year , unk up a 190.58-point , or 6.9 % , loss on the day in unk trading volume . unk trading accelerated to unk million shares , a record for the big board . at the end of the day , unk million shares were traded . the dow jones industrials closed at unk .
the dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the unk black monday crash that occurred oct. 19 , 1987 . in percentage terms , however , the dow 's dive was the unk ever and the unk since the market fell unk , or 8 % , a week after black monday . the dow fell unk % on black monday .
shares of ual , the parent of united airlines , were extremely active all day friday , reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $ 6.79 billion buy-out of the airline by an unk group . wall street 's takeover-stock speculators , or `` risk arbitragers , '' had placed unusually large unk that a takeover would succeed and ual stock would rise .
at unk p.m. edt , came the unk news : the big board was unk trading in ual , `` pending news . '' on the exchange floor , `` as soon as ual stopped trading , we unk for a panic , '' said one top floor trader . several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news unk .
for weeks , the market had been nervous about takeovers , after campeau corp. 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers . and 10 minutes after the ual trading halt came news that the ual group could n't get financing for its bid . at this point , the dow was down about 35 points .
the market unk . arbitragers could n't dump their ual stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every `` rumor '' stock they had . for example , their selling caused trading unk to be declared in usair group , which closed down 3 7\/8 to 41 1\/2 , delta air lines , which fell 7 3\/4 to 69 1\/4 , and philips industries , which sank 3 to 21 1\/2 .
these stocks eventually reopened . but as panic spread , speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as philip morris and international business machines to offset their losses . when trading was halted in philip morris , the stock was trading at 41 , down 3 3\/8 , while ibm closed 5 5\/8 lower at 102 .
selling unk because of waves of automatic `` stop-loss '' orders , which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels . most of the stock selling pressure came from wall street professionals , including computer-guided program traders . traders said most of their major institutional investors , on the other hand , sat tight .
now , at unk , one of the market 's post-crash `` reforms '' took hold as the s&p 500 futures contract had plunged 12 points , equivalent to around a unk drop in the dow industrials . under an agreement signed by the big board and the chicago mercantile exchange , trading was temporarily halted in chicago .
after the trading halt in the s&p 500 pit in chicago , waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the big board , and specialists continued to unk prices down . as a result , the link between the futures and stock markets unk apart . without the unk of stock-index futures -- the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed -- many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the big board . the futures halt was even unk by big board floor traders . `` it unk things up , '' said one major specialist .
this confusion effectively halted one form of program trading , stock index arbitrage , that closely links the futures and stock markets , and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings . ( in a stock-index arbitrage sell program , traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference . )
`` when the airline information came through , it unk every model we had for the marketplace , '' said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms . `` we did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do . ''
but stocks kept falling . the dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the unk halt . at unk p.m. , at the end of the `` cooling off '' period , the average was down unk points . meanwhile , during the the s&p trading halt , s&p futures sell orders began unk up , while stocks in new york kept falling sharply .
big board chairman john j. phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker `` worked well unk . i just think it 's unk at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things . ''
under another post-crash system , big board president richard unk ( mr. phelan was flying to unk as the market was falling ) was talking on an `` unk hot line '' to the other exchanges , the securities and exchange commission and the federal reserve board . he unk out at a high-tech unk center on the floor of the big board , where he could watch unk on prices and pending stock orders .
at about unk p.m. edt , s&p futures resumed trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line . buyers stepped in to the futures pit . but the unk of s&p futures sell orders weighed on the market , and the link with stocks began to fray again .
at about unk , the s&p market unk to still another limit , of 30 points down , and trading was locked again . futures traders say the s&p was unk that the dow could fall as much as 200 points .
during this time , small investors began ringing their brokers , wondering whether another crash had begun . at prudential-bache securities inc. , which is trying to cater to small investors , some unk brokers thought this would be the final unk .
that 's when george l. ball , chairman of the prudential insurance co. of america unit , took to the internal unk system to declare that the plunge was only `` mechanical . ''
`` i have a unk that this particular decline today is something ` more unk about less . ' it would be my unk to advise clients not to sell , to look for an opportunity to buy , '' mr. ball told the brokers .
at merrill lynch & co. , the nation 's biggest brokerage firm , a news release was prepared unk `` merrill lynch comments on market drop . '' the release cautioned that `` there are significant differences between the current environment and that of october 1987 '' and that there are still `` attractive investment opportunities '' in the stock market .
however , jeffrey b. lane , president of shearson lehman hutton inc. , said that friday 's plunge is `` going to set back '' relations with customers , `` because it unk the concern of volatility . and i think a lot of people will unk on program trading . it 's going to bring the debate right back to the unk . ''
as the dow average ground to its final unk loss friday , the s&p pit stayed locked at its unk trading limit . jeffrey unk of program trader unk investment group said 2,000 s&p contracts were for sale on the close , the equivalent of $ unk million in stock . but there were no buyers .
while friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors , it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning , traders said . stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself . at those levels , stocks are set up to be unk by index arbitragers , who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall , and simultaneously sell off stocks . but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today .
the unk between the stock and futures markets friday will unk cause renewed debate about whether wall street is properly prepared for another crash situation . the big board 's mr. unk said , `` our unk performance was good . '' but the exchange will `` look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks . obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the unk obligations were n't met , '' he said .

but specialists complain privately that just as in the 1987 crash , the `` unk '' firms -- big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock -- stayed on the sidelines during friday 's unk . mr. phelan said , `` it will take another day or two '' to analyze who was buying and selling friday .

ports of call inc. reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that were n't disclosed .
the agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes the travel company has sold this year as part of a restructuring . the company said a portion of the $ 32 million realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended unk operations .
earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of boeing co. unk because of increasing maintenance costs .
a consortium of private investors operating as unk funding co. said it has made a $ unk million cash bid for most of l.j. hooker corp. 's real-estate and unk holdings .
the $ unk million bid includes the assumption of an estimated $ 300 million in secured liabilities on those properties , according to those making the bid .
the group is led by jay unk , chief executive officer of unk investment corp. in unk , and a. boyd simpson , chief executive of the atlanta-based simpson organization inc . mr. unk 's company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims to have $ 1 billion in assets ; mr. simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of l.j. hooker .
`` the assets are good , but they require more money and management '' than can be provided in l.j. hooker 's current situation , said mr. simpson in an interview . `` hooker 's philosophy was to build and sell . we want to build and hold . ''
l.j. hooker , based in atlanta , is operating with protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code . its parent company , hooker corp. of sydney , australia , is currently being managed by a unk provisional unk . sanford unk , chief executive of l.j. hooker , said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee .
the $ unk million bid is estimated by mr. simpson as representing 75 % of the value of all hooker real-estate holdings in the u.s . not included in the bid are unk teller or b. altman & co. , l.j. hooker 's department-store chains .
the offer covers the massive 1.8 unk forest fair mall in cincinnati , the 800,000 unk unk fashion mall in columbia , s.c. , and the unk unk unk town center mall in unk , unk . the unk mall opened sept. 19 with a unk 's unk as its unk ; the columbia mall is expected to open nov. 15 .
other hooker properties included are a unk office tower in unk atlanta , expected to be completed next february ; vacant land sites in florida and ohio ; l.j. hooker international , the commercial real-estate brokerage company that once did business as merrill lynch commercial real estate , plus other shopping centers .
the consortium was put together by unk unk , the london-based investment banking company that is a subsidiary of security pacific corp . `` we do n't anticipate any problems in raising the funding for the bid , '' said allan campbell , the head of mergers and acquisitions at unk unk , in an interview . unk unk is acting as the consortium 's investment bankers .
according to people familiar with the consortium , the bid was unk project unk , a reference to the film `` unk '' in which a unk played by actress unk unk is saved from a unk businessman by a police officer named john unk .
l.j. hooker was a small unk company based in atlanta in 1979 when mr. simpson was hired to push it into commercial development . the company grew modestly until 1986 , when a majority position in hooker corp. was acquired by australian developer george unk , currently hooker 's chairman .
mr. unk unk to launch an ambitious , but unk , $ 1 billion acquisition unk that included unk teller and b. altman & co. , as well as majority positions in merksamer jewelers , a sacramento chain ; unk inc. , the unk retailer , and unk inc. , the southeast department-store chain .
eventually mr. simpson and mr. unk had a falling out over the direction of the company , and mr. simpson said he resigned in 1988 . since then , hooker corp. has sold its interest in the unk chain back to unk 's management and is currently attempting to sell the b. altman & co. chain . in addition , robert unk , chief executive of the unk chain , is seeking funds to buy out the hooker interest in his company . the merksamer chain is currently being offered for sale by first boston corp .
reached in unk , mr. unk said that he believes the various hooker unk can become profitable with new management . `` these are n't mature assets , but they have the potential to be so , '' said mr. unk . `` managed properly , and with a long-term outlook , these can become investment-grade quality properties . ''

as small investors unk their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend , big fund managers said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals : cash .
unlike the weekend before black monday , the funds were n't unk with heavy withdrawal requests . and many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week .
at fidelity investments , the nation 's largest fund company , telephone volume was up sharply , but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding black monday in 1987 . the boston firm said unk unk were running at less than one-third the level two years ago . as of yesterday afternoon , the unk represented less than 15 % of the total cash position of about $ 2 billion of fidelity 's stock funds .
`` two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around , '' said c. bruce unk , who runs fidelity investments ' $ 5 billion unk fund . `` this feels more like a unk deal . people are n't unk . ''
the test may come today . friday 's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act . some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices . stock fund unk during the 1987 debacle did n't begin to unk until after the market opened on black monday .
but fund managers say they 're ready . many have raised cash levels , which act as a unk against steep market declines . mario unk , for instance , holds cash positions well above 20 % in several of his funds . windsor fund 's john unk and mutual series ' michael price said they had raised their cash levels to more than 20 % and 30 % , respectively , this year .
even peter lynch , manager of fidelity 's $ 12.7 billion unk fund , the nation 's largest stock fund , built up cash to 7 % or $ 850 million . one reason is that after two years of monthly net unk , the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in august and september .
`` i 've let the money build up , '' mr. lynch said , who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes .
not all funds have raised cash levels , of course . as a group , stock funds held 10.2 % of assets in cash as of august , the latest figures available from the investment company institute . that was modestly higher than the 8.8 % and 9.2 % levels in august and september of 1987 . also , persistent unk would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash .
but a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around , fund managers said . a major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since black monday . unk sales have rebounded in recent months , but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half 1987 levels .
`` there 's not nearly as much unk , '' said john unk , chairman of vanguard group inc. , a big valley forge , pa. , fund company .
many fund managers argue that now 's the time to buy . vincent unk , manager of the $ 1.8 billion wellington fund , added to his positions in bristol-myers squibb , woolworth and dun & bradstreet friday . and today he 'll be looking to buy drug stocks like eli lilly , pfizer and american home products whose dividend yields have been bolstered by stock declines .
fidelity 's mr. lynch , for his part , snapped up southern co. shares friday after the stock got unk . if the market drops further today , he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as bristol-myers and kellogg . `` if they unk stocks like that , '' he said , it presents an opportunity that is `` the kind of thing you dream about . ''
major mutual-fund groups said phone calls were unk at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday . but most investors were seeking share prices and other information . trading volume was only modestly higher than normal .
still , fund groups are n't taking any chances . they hope to avoid the unk phone lines and other unk that unk some fund investors in october 1987 .
fidelity on saturday opened its 54 unk investor centers across the country . the centers normally are closed through the weekend . in addition , east coast centers will open at unk edt this morning , instead of the normal unk .
t. rowe price associates inc. increased its staff of phone representatives to handle investor requests . the unk group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money-market funds . but most investors seemed to be `` in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode , '' said steven unk , a vice president .
and vanguard , among other groups , said it was adding more phone representatives today to help investors get through .
in an unusual move , several funds moved to calm investors with unk on their unk phone lines . `` we view { friday 's } market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors , '' a recording at unk & co. funds said over the weekend . the unk group had a similar recording for investors .
several fund managers expect a rough market this morning before prices stabilize . some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits . stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of 25 % through september , according to lipper analytical services inc .
unk unk , who runs shearson lehman hutton inc. 's $ unk million sector analysis portfolio , predicts the market will open down at least 50 points on technical factors and `` some panic selling . '' but she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market wo n't decline more than 10 % to 15 % from recent highs . `` this is not a major crash , '' she said .
nevertheless , ms. unk said she was unk with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders . `` half of them are really scared and want to sell , '' she said , `` but i 'm trying to talk them out of it . '' she added , `` if they all were bullish , i 'd really be upset . ''
the unk to friday 's slide was unk different from that of the october 1987 crash , fund managers argue . two years ago , unlike today , the dollar was weak , interest rates were rising and the market was very unk , they say .
`` from the investors ' standpoint , institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson ... by selling at the lows '' on black monday , said stephen unk , manager of the $ unk million t. rowe price growth and income fund . this time , `` i do n't think we 'll get a panic reaction . ''
newport corp. said it expects to report unk earnings of between 15 cents and 19 cents a share , somewhat below analysts ' estimates of 19 cents to 23 cents .
the maker of scientific instruments and laser parts said orders fell below expectations in recent months .
a spokesman added that sales in the current quarter will about equal the unk quarter 's figure , when newport reported net income of $ 1.7 million , or 21 cents a share , on $ unk million in sales .
unk from the strike by 55,000 machinists union members against boeing co. reached air carriers friday as america west airlines announced it will postpone its new service out of houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the seattle jet maker .
peter unk , vice president for planning at the phoenix , ariz. , carrier , said in an interview that the work unk at boeing , now entering its 13th day , `` has caused some turmoil in our unk '' and that more than 500 passengers who were unk to fly out of houston on america west would now be put on other airlines .
mr. unk said boeing told america west that the unk it was supposed to get this thursday would n't be delivered until nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to unk service at houston with four daily flights , including three unk to phoenix and one unk to las vegas . now , those routes are n't expected to begin until unk .
boeing is also supposed to send to america west another unk unk aircraft as well as a unk by year 's end . those , too , are almost certain to arrive late .
at this point , no other america west flights -- including its new service at san antonio , texas ; newark , n.j. ; and unk , calif. -- have been affected by the delays in boeing deliveries .
nevertheless , the company 's reaction unk the unk effect that a huge manufacturer such as boeing can have on other parts of the economy . it also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company .
`` i just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged unk , '' tom baker , president of machinists ' district unk , said in an interview yesterday . `` i do n't think their customers would like it very much . ''
america west , though , is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be . `` i figure that american and united probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their unk , they might not miss one at all , '' mr. unk said .
indeed , a random check friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations . southwest airlines has a boeing unk set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time . `` it 's so close to completion , boeing 's told us there wo n't be a problem , '' said a southwest spokesman .
a spokesman for amr corp. said boeing has assured american airlines it will deliver a unk on time later this month . american is preparing to take delivery of another unk in early december and 20 more next year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable .
in seattle , a boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike .
meanwhile , supervisors and unk employees have been trying to finish some 40 aircraft -- mostly 747 and unk jumbo jets at the company 's unk , wash. , plant -- that were all but completed before the unk . as of friday , four had been delivered and a fifth plane , a unk , was supposed to be unk out over the weekend to air china .
no date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table . `` we want to make sure they know what they want before they come back , '' said unk hammond , the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began .
the investment community , for one , has been anticipating a unk resolution . though boeing 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market friday , it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders . `` the market has taken two views : that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very unk for boeing in the long term , '' said howard unk , an analyst at unk j. lawrence inc . boeing 's shares fell $ 4 friday to close at $ unk in composite trading on the new york stock exchange .
but mr. baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month , unk that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week . still , he said , it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer . `` i would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything . ''
last week , boeing chairman frank unk sent striking workers a letter , saying that `` to my knowledge , boeing 's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major u.s. industrial firm in recent history . ''
but mr. baker called the letter -- and the company 's offer of a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus bonuses -- `` very weak . '' he added that the company unk the union 's resolve and the workers ' unk with being forced to work many hours overtime .
in separate developments :
-- talks have broken off between machinists representatives at lockheed corp. and the unk , calif. , aerospace company . the union is continuing to work through its expired contract , however . it had planned a strike vote for next sunday , but that has been pushed back indefinitely .
-- united auto workers local unk , which represents 3,000 workers at boeing 's helicopter unit in delaware county , pa. , said it agreed to extend its contract on a unk basis , with a unk notification to cancel , while it continues bargaining . the accord expired yesterday .
-- and boeing on friday said it received an order from unk unk for four model unk unk unk valued at a total of about $ unk million .
the planes , long range versions of the unk unk , will be delivered with unk & unk unk engines . unk & unk is a unit of united technologies inc . unk unk is based in amsterdam .
a boeing spokeswoman said a delivery date for the planes is still being worked out `` for a variety of reasons , but not because of the strike . ''

unk ltd. said its utilities arm is considering building new electric power plants , some valued at more than one billion canadian dollars ( us$ unk million ) , in great britain and elsewhere .
unk unk , unk 's senior vice president , finance , said its unk canadian utilities ltd. unit is reviewing unk projects in eastern canada , and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere , including britain , where the british government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private-sector suppliers as part of its privatization program .
`` the projects are big . they can be c$ 1 billion plus , '' mr. unk said . `` but we would n't go into them alone , '' and canadian utilities ' equity stake would be small , he said . `` unk , we 'd like to be the operator { of the project } and a modest equity investor . our long suit is our proven ability to operate '' power plants , he said .
mr. unk would n't offer unk regarding unk 's proposed british project , but he said it would compete for customers with two huge british power generating companies that would be formed under the country 's plan to unk its massive water and electric utilities .
britain 's government plans to raise about # 20 billion ( $ unk billion ) from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities , beginning next month . the planned electric utility sale , scheduled for next year , is alone expected to raise # 13 billion , making it the world 's largest public offering .
under terms of the plan , independent unk would be able to compete for 15 % of customers until 1994 , and for another 10 % between 1994 and 1998 .
canadian utilities had 1988 revenue of c$ unk billion , mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in alberta , where the company serves about 800,000 customers .
`` there seems to be a move around the world to unk the generation of electricity , '' mr. unk said , and canadian utilities hopes to capitalize on it . `` this is a real thrust on our utility side , '' he said , adding that canadian utilities is also unk projects in unk countries , though he would be specific .
canadian utilities is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in britain , in anticipation of the privatization program . `` we 're certainly looking at some power generating projects in england , '' said bruce unk , vice president , corporate strategy and corporate planning , with unk corp. , houston , a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator .
mr. unk said unk is considering building unk power plants in the u.k. capable of producing about 500 unk of power at a cost of about $ 300 million to $ 400 million .
pse inc. said it expects to report third earnings of $ 1.3 million to $ 1.7 million , or 14 cents to 18 cents a share .
in the year-ago quarter , the designer and operator of unk and waste heat recovery plants had net income of $ unk , or four cents a share , on revenue of about $ unk million . the company said the improvement is related to additional unk facilities that have been put into operation .

unk & broad home corp. said it formed a $ unk million limited partnership subsidiary to buy land in california suitable for residential development .
the partnership , unk & broad land development venture limited partnership , is a 50-50 joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of unk advisory corp. , a unit of unk financial corp. , a real estate advisory , management and development company with offices in chicago and beverly hills , calif . unk & broad , a home building company , declined to identify the institutional investors .
the land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received unk and other approvals required for development , and part of unk & broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals .
the partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said bruce unk , president and chief executive officer of unk & broad .
`` there are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash . typically , developers option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , '' said mr. unk , adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind . `` we usually operate in that conservative manner . ''
by setting up the joint venture , unk & broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land , while avoiding the negative unk to its own balance sheet , mr. unk said . the company is putting up only 10 % of the capital , although it is responsible for providing management , planning and processing services to the joint venture .
`` this is one of the best ways to assure a pipeline of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company , '' mr. unk said .
when the price of plastics took off in 1987 , quantum chemical corp. went along for the ride .
the timing of quantum 's chief executive officer , john unk unk , appeared to be nothing less than inspired , because he had just increased quantum 's reliance on plastics . the company unk much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew unk in two years . mr. unk said of the boom , `` it 's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks . ''
but now prices have unk and quantum 's profit is unk . some securities analysts are looking for no better than unk results from the company for the third quarter , compared with year-earlier profit of $ unk million , or $ unk a share , on sales of $ unk million . the stock , having lost nearly a quarter of its value since sept. 1 , closed at $ unk share , down $ 1.125 , in new york stock exchange composite trading friday .
to a degree , quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that unk modern life . having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history , these producers now see their prices unk .
pricing cycles , to be sure , are nothing new for plastics producers . and the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the unk period that is just behind them . `` we were all wonderful unk last year , '' says an executive at one of quantum 's competitors . `` now we 're at the bottom of the unk . ''
at quantum , which is based in new york , the trouble is unk by the company 's heavy unk on plastics . once known as national unk & chemical corp. , the company unk the wine and spirits business and unk more of its resources into plastics after mr. unk took the chief executive 's job in 1986 . mr. unk , 59 years old , declined to be interviewed for this article , but he has consistently argued that over the long haul -- across both the unk and the unk of the plastics market -- quantum will unk through its new direction .
quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene unk , used to make garbage bags , milk unk , unk , toys and meat packaging , among other items . in the u.s. polyethylene market , quantum has claimed the largest share , about 20 % . but its competitors -- including dow chemical co. , union carbide corp. and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests and so are better unk against price swings .
when the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound , quantum 's annual profit unk by about 85 cents a share , provided no other unk are changing . in recent months the price of polyethylene , even more than that of other commodity plastics , has taken a dive . benchmark grades , which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring , have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents .
meanwhile , the price of unk , the chemical building block of polyethylene , has n't dropped nearly so fast . that unk unk quantum badly , because its own plants cover only about half of its unk needs .
by many accounts , an early unk of a price unk in the making came at the start of this year . china , which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene , abruptly halted them . unk that excess polyethylene would soon be unk around the world , other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product .
kenneth mitchell , director of dow 's polyethylene business , says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices unk up . `` people were even unk bags , '' he says .
now producers hope prices have hit bottom . they recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks . no one knows , however , whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to unk .
one unk is george unk , a unk analyst at oppenheimer & co. and a bear on plastics stocks . noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained , he remarks , `` some say october . some say november . i say 1992 . '' he argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers ' plans to expand production capacity .
a quick turnaround is crucial to quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy . the company is trying to carry out a three-year , $ 1.3 billion unk program started this year . at the same time , its annual payments on long-term debt will more than double from a year ago to about $ 240 million , largely because of debt taken on to pay a $ unk special dividend earlier this year .
quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the unk with its holders , because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases . some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to unk takeover speculation .
whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend , raised 36 % to 75 cents a share only a year ago , has become a topic of intense speculation on wall street since mr. unk unk dividend questions in a sept. 29 meeting with analysts .
some viewed his response -- that company directors review the dividend regularly -- as nothing more than the standard line from executives . but others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual unk performance . in any case , on the day of the meeting , quantum 's shares slid $ unk to $ unk in big board trading .
on top of everything else , quantum unk a disaster at its plant in morris , ill . after an explosion unk the plant in june , the company unk in september to within 12 hours of completing the unk process of unk it . then a second explosion occurred . two workers died and six remain in the hospital .
this human toll adds the most painful unk yet to the sudden change in quantum 's fortunes . until this year , the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up unk safety unk .
a prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another unk into quantum 's financial future . when a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand , unk lost profit and thus claims under unk insurance is unk . but the numbers become unk -- and subject to unk between insured and insurer -- when demand is shifting .
`` you say you could have sold x percent of this product and unk percent of that , '' recalls unk unk , an analyst at shearson lehman hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer . `` and then you still have to negotiate . ''
quantum hopes the morris plant , where limited production got under way last week , will resume full operation by year 's end . the plant usually accounts for 20 % to 25 % of quantum 's polyethylene production and 50 % of its unk production .
not everything looks grim for quantum . the plant expansion should strengthen the company 's unk in the polyethylene business , where market share is often taken through sheer capacity . by unk unk production , the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs .
quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals , unk marketing . through a venture with its investment banker , first boston corp. , quantum completed in august an acquisition of unk inc. in a transaction valued at $ 1.18 billion . unk is the second-largest unk distributor in the u.s . the largest , suburban unk , was already owned by quantum .
still , quantum has a crisis to get past right now . some analysts speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor . the name unk in rumors is british petroleum co. , which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the u.s .
asked about a bid for quantum , a unk spokesman says , `` we pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors , and i think that falls in that category . ''
rjr nabisco inc. is unk its division responsible for buying network advertising time , just a month after moving 11 of the group 's 14 employees to new york from atlanta .
a spokesman for the new york-based food and tobacco giant , taken private earlier this year in a $ 25 billion leveraged buy-out by kohlberg kravis roberts & co. , confirmed that it is unk down the rjr nabisco broadcast unit , and unk its 14 employees , in a move to save money . the spokesman said rjr is discussing its unk plans with its two main advertising firms , unk katz and unk unk .
`` we found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost , '' said the spokesman , who declined to specify how much rjr spends on network television time . an executive close to the company said rjr is spending about $ 140 million on network television time this year , down from roughly $ 200 million last year .
the spokesman said the broadcast unit will be unk dec. 1 , and the move wo n't affect rjr 's print , radio and unk buying practices .
the broadcast group had been based in new york until a year ago , when rjr 's previous management moved it to atlanta , the company 's headquarters before this summer . one employee with the group said rjr moved 11 employees of the group back to new york in september because `` there was supposed to be a future . '' he said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks , unk them from jobs with advertising agencies .
the rjr spokesman said the company moved the 11 employees to new york last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' unk season . `` the studies { on closing the unit } could n't be completed until now , '' he said .
the group 's president , peter unk , was n't in his office friday afternoon to comment .
the u.s. , which is unk its unk quotas , is unk a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unk steel industries .
meanwhile , the u.s. has negotiated a significant cut in japan 's steel quota , and made only a minor increase to the steel unk for the european community .
brazil , similar to mexico and south korea , is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the u.s. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas , which expired sept. 30 . brazil and venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the u.s. for the year ending oct. 1 , 1990 .
in recent years , u.s. steelmakers have supplied about 80 % of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation . of the remaining 20 % needed , the unk negotiations unk about 15 % to foreign suppliers , with the difference supplied mainly by canada -- which is n't included in the quota program . other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the u.s. , such as taiwan , sweden and argentina , also have supplied steel . some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the u.s. that are similar to quotas .
the bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas , known as voluntary restraint agreements , until march 31 , 1992 . it also said it would use that unk year period to work toward an international consensus on unk up the international steel trade , which has been unk managed , subsidized and protected by governments . the u.s. termed its plan , a `` trade unk program , '' despite the fact that it is merely an extension .
mexico , which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the u.s. , virtually doubled its quota to unk % of the u.s. steel market from unk % under the previous quotas . south korea , which had 1.9 % under the previous quotas , is set to get a small increase to about unk % . that increase rises to slightly more than 2 % of the u.s. market if a joint unk steel project is included . meanwhile , brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the unk % share it has had in recent years .
the ec and japan -- the u.s. 's largest steel suppliers -- have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent . the ec steel industry , which has been unk with strong european demand , has been unk about 5 % of the u.s. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7 % . japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5 % of the u.s. market compared with a quota of 5.9 % .
in the recent talks , the ec had its quota increased about 300,000 tons , to 7 % of the u.s. market from 6.7 % in 1988 . but its quota has been as high as 6.9 % in 1984 . japan , however , has agreed to cut its quota to about 5 % from 5.9 % previously .
japan , the ec , brazil , mexico and south korea provide about 80 % of the steel imported to the u.s. under the quota program . the balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters , such as australia and venezuela .
the u.s. had about an extra 2 % of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks . that was essentially made up of a 1 % increase in the overall quota program and 1 % from cutting japan 's allowance .
negotiators from the white house trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another 1 % of the u.s. steel market to unk .
these unk unk increases to the steel quota program are built into the bush administration 's unk program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and unk from their own steel industries .
unk inc. expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to trail 1988 results , but anticipates that several new products will lead to a `` much stronger '' performance in its second half .
unk , a telecommunications company , had net income of $ unk , or five cents a share , in its year-earlier second quarter , ended sept. 30 . revenue totaled $ 5 million . george pierce , chairman and chief executive officer , said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ 4 million .
the lower results , mr. pierce said , reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay unk , unk 's primary business . although mr. pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year , he said unk will also benefit from moving into other areas .
foremost among those is the company 's unk into the public facsimile business , mr. pierce said . within the next year , unk expects to place 10,000 fax machines , made by unk in japan , in hotels , municipal buildings , unk and other public unk around the country . unk will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect , store and forward billing data .
mr. pierce said unk should realize a minimum of $ 10 of unk net earnings for each machine each month .
unk has also developed an automatic call unk that will make further use of the company 's system for unk and handling credit-card calls and collect calls . automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone , mr. pierce said , not just phones produced by unk .
the company will also be producing a new line of convenience unk , which do n't accept coins , for use in hotel unk , office unk , unk unk and similar unk .
mr. pierce estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $ 5 of unk net earnings for each machine each month .
britain 's retail price index rose 0.7 % in september from august and was up 7.6 % for the year , the central statistical office said .
unk medical inc. said it adopted a shareholders ' rights plan in which rights to purchase shares of common stock will be distributed as a dividend to shareholders of record as of oct. 23 .
the company said the plan was n't adopted in response to any known offers for unk , a maker and marketer of hospital products .
the rights allow shareholders to purchase unk stock at a discount if any person or group acquires more than 15 % of the company 's common stock or unk a tender offer .
measuring unk may soon be replaced by unk in the unk room .
procter & gamble co. plans to begin testing next month a unk unk that will require only a few unk per unk .
the move stems from unk learned in japan where local competitors have had unk success with concentrated unk . it also marks p&g 's growing concern that its japanese rivals , such as unk corp. , may bring their unk to the u.s .
the cincinnati unk giant got unk two years ago in japan when unk introduced a powerful unk , called attack , which quickly won a 30 % stake in the japanese markets . `` they do n't want to get caught again , '' says one industry unk .
retailers in phoenix , ariz. , say p&g 's new unk unk -- to be called unk with color guard -- will be on shelves in that market by early november . a p&g spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to phoenix started late last month . she said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others .
unk are n't entirely new for p&g . the company introduced a unk unk unk in japan after watching the success of attack . when attack hit the shelves in 1987 , p&g 's share of the japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % . with the help of unk unk , p&g 's share is now estimated to be 12 % .
while the japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for p&g will be in the $ 4 billion u.s. unk market , where growth is slow and unk have gained unk over unk . the company may have chosen to market the product under the unk name since it 's already expanded its unk tide into 16 different unk , including this year 's big hit , tide with unk . with unk , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many people tend to dump too much unk into the unk machine , unk that it takes a cup of unk to really clean the unk .
in the early 1980s , p&g tried to launch here a concentrated unk under the unk brand name that it markets in europe . but the product , which was n't as concentrated as the new unk , unk in a market test in denver and was dropped .
p&g and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on unk and fabric unk unk in unk , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience .
but p&g contends the new unk is a unique formula that also offers an unk that prevents colors from unk . and retailers are expected to unk the product , in part because it will take up less shelf space . `` when shelf space was cheap , bigger was better , '' says unk unk , an analyst at salomon unk . but with so many brands unk for space , that 's no longer the case . if the new unk sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own unk . then retailers `` will probably push the { unk } brands out altogether , '' he says .
competition is bound to get tougher if unk unk a product like attack in the u.s . to be sure , unk would n't have an easy time taking u.s. market share away from the unk p&g , which has about 23 % of the market .
unk officials previously have said they are interested in selling unk in the u.s. , but so far the company has focused on acquisitions , such as last year 's purchase of andrew unk co. , a cincinnati unk maker . it also has a unk facility in california .
some believe p&g 's interest in a unk unk goes beyond the concern for the japanese . `` this is something p&g would do with or without unk , '' says mr. unk .
with economic tension between the u.s. and japan worsening , many japanese had feared last week 's visit from u.s. trade representative unk hills . they expected a new unk of demands that japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the u.s .
instead , they got a discussion of the need for the u.s. and japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view . mrs. hills ' first trip to japan as america 's chief trade unk had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by commerce secretary robert a. mosbacher .
mr. mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade . he said such results should be `` unk in dollars and cents '' in reducing the u.s. trade deficit with japan .
but mrs. hills , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the american chamber of commerce in japan on saturday , stressed that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action . '' she added that she expected `` perhaps to have a down payment ... some small step to convince the american people and the japanese people that we 're moving in unk . ''
how such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for months . american and japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach unk mr. mosbacher and mrs. hills . many called it simply a contrast in styles . but some saw it as a classic negotiating unk . others said the bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand . and some said it reflected the growing debate in washington over pursuing free trade with japan unk some kind of managed trade .
asked to compare her visit to mr. mosbacher 's , mrs. hills replied : `` i did n't hear every word he spoke , but as a general proposition , i think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the bush administration . '' yet more than one american official who sat in with her during three days of talks with japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly `` unk . ''
`` i think my line has been very consistent , '' mrs. hills said at a news conference saturday afternoon . `` i am painted sometimes as unk , perhaps because i have a unk list of statutes to implement . i do n't feel very unk . i do n't feel either hard or soft . i feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade . ''
when she met the local press for the first time on friday , mrs. hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products , unk and unk , three areas targeted under the unk unk provision of the 1988 trade bill . she unk unk business practices that the u.s. government has identified . but her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition . she said the trade unk was mainly due to unk factors and should n't be unk by setting unk targets .
at her news conference for japanese reporters , one economics journalist unk up the japanese sense of relief . `` my impression was that you would be a unk old lady , '' he said , drawing a few nervous unk from his colleagues . `` but i am relieved to see that you are beautiful and unk and unk and a person of integrity . ''
mrs. hills ' remarks did raise questions , at least among some u.s. officials , about what exactly her stance is on u.s. access to the japanese semiconductor market . the u.s. share of the japanese market has been stuck around 10 % for years . many americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as unk u.s. companies a 20 % share by 1991 , but the japanese have denied making any such promise .
at one of her news unk , mrs. hills said , `` i believe we can do much better than 20 % . '' but she stressed , `` i am against managed trade . i will not enter into an agreement that unk to a percentage of the market . ''
traditional industries inc. said it expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter that ended june 30 and is seeking new financing .
the seller of photographic products and services said it is considering a number of financing alternatives , including seeking increases in its credit lines .
traditional declined to estimate the amount of the loss and would n't say if it expects to show a profit for the year . in the year ended june 30 , 1988 , traditional reported net income of $ 4.9 million , or $ unk a share . the company did n't break out its fourth-quarter results . in the latest nine months net income was $ 4.7 million , or $ unk a share , on revenue of $ unk million .
separately , the company said it would file a delayed unk report with the securities and exchange commission `` within approximately 45 days . '' it said the delay resulted from difficulties in unk its accounting of a settlement with the federal trade commission . under an agreement filed in federal court in august to settle ftc objections to some traditional sales practices , traditional said it would establish a $ 250,000 trust fund to provide refunds to certain customers .
information international inc. said it was sued by a buyer of its computerized unk system , alleging that the company failed to correct deficiencies in the system .
a spokesman for information international said the lawsuit by two units of morris communications corp. seeks unk of the system 's about $ 3 million purchase price and unk of a software license provided by the morris units to information international for alleged failure to pay royalties .
information international said it believes that the complaints , filed in federal court in georgia , are without merit . closely held morris communications is based in unk , unk . the units that filed the suit are unk newspapers corp. and florida publishing co .
unk corp. completed the sale of its a. unk & co. subsidiary , a men 's luxury unk , to unk investments .
terms were n't disclosed .
as unk 's `` core business of unk retailing grows , a small subsidiary that is unk unrelated becomes a difficult unk , '' said unk unk , president of the parent , in a statement .
a spokeswoman said unk operates a total of seven stores in the u.s. and overseas . unk operates 25 unk apparel stores in the u.s .
the oil industry 's unk profits could unk through the rest of the year .
major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . the gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say , reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance .
the industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , '' glenn cox , president of phillips petroleum co. , said in an interview . `` that change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings '' for the industry in general , he added . he did n't forecast phillips 's results .
but securities analysts say phillips will be among the companies unk by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings . so , too , many analysts predict , will exxon corp. , chevron corp. and amoco corp .
typical is what happened to the price of unk , a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies . it has plunged 13 % since july to around 26 cents a pound . a year ago unk sold for 33 cents , unk at about 34 cents last december .
a big reason for the chemical price retreat is unk . beginning in unk , prices began accelerating as a growing u.s. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand . companies added capacity unk . now , greatly increased supplies are on the market , while the dollar is stronger , and domestic economic growth is slower .
third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker . `` refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year , '' said william unk , a securities analyst at first boston corp .
oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in july and august that did n't unk . the excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period . in addition , crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier , further unk profitability .
refiners say margins picked up in september , and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter , though still not to the level of 1988 's fourth quarter . during the 1988 second half , many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits .
crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year . prices -- averaging roughly $ 2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- have stayed well above most companies ' expectations . demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically unk in the fourth quarter . `` we could see higher oil prices this year , '' said unk unk , an analyst at painewebber inc .
that will translate into sharply higher production profits , particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ 13 a barrel in the fourth quarter .
while oil prices have been better than expected , natural gas prices have been worse . in the third quarter , they averaged about 5 % less than they were in 1988 . the main reason remains weather . last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to unk more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air unk use . this summer , on the other hand , had unk weather than usual .
`` we 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices , '' said mr. cox , phillips 's president . `` the lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected . ''
going into the fourth quarter , natural gas prices are anywhere from 8 % to 17 % lower than a year earlier . for instance , natural gas currently produced along the gulf coast is selling on the spot market for around $ unk a thousand cubic feet , down 13 % from $ unk a thousand cubic feet a year ago .
the bush administration , trying to unk growing demands from western europe for a unk of controls on exports to the soviet bloc , is questioning whether italy 's unk . c. olivetti & co. supplied unk valuable technology to the soviets .
most of the western european members of unk committee on unk export controls , the unk unk through which the u.s. and its allies unk their unk policies , are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in paris oct. 25 and 26 . they plan to press specifically for a unk of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high-technology products .
but the bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all cocom members are unk fully with existing unk procedures before it will support further unk . to make its point , it is challenging the italian government to explain reports that olivetti may have supplied the soviet union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft .
the london sunday times , which first reported the u.s. concerns , cited a u.s. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that olivetti exported $ 25 million in `` unk , unk , flexible manufacturing systems to the soviet aviation industry . '' olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984 .
a state department spokesman acknowledged that the u.s. is discussing the allegations with the italian government and cocom , but declined to confirm any details . italian president unk unk promised a quick investigation into whether olivetti broke cocom rules . president bush called his attention to the matter during the italian leader 's visit here last week .
olivetti has denied that it violated cocom rules , unk that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the italian authorities .
although the unk of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better unk to support the position of unk unk in the pentagon and the intelligence community . `` it seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important cocom meeting , '' said a washington lobbyist for a number of u.s. computer companies .
the bush administration has sent unk signals about its unk policies , reflecting unk divisions among several competing agencies . last summer , mr. bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual unk when he told a north atlantic treaty organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the cocom unk of strategic goods . but more recently , the pentagon and the commerce department openly unk over the extent to which cocom should unk exports of personal computers to the bloc .
however , these agencies generally agree that the west should be cautious about any further unk . `` there 's no evidence that the soviet program to ( illegally ) acquire western technology has diminished , '' said a state department spokesman .
salomon brothers international ltd. , a british subsidiary of salomon inc. , announced it will issue warrants on shares of hong kong telecommunications ltd .
the move closely follows a similar offer by salomon of warrants for shares of unk & unk banking corp .
under the latest offer , hk$ 62.5 million ( us$ 8 million ) of three-year warrants will be issued in london , each giving buyers the right to buy one hong kong telecommunications share at a price to be determined friday .
the 50 million warrants will be priced at hk$ 1.25 each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about 26 % . in trading on the stock exchange of hong kong , the shares closed wednesday at hk$ unk each . at this price , the shares would have to rise above hk$ unk for subscribers to salomon 's issue to unk convert their warrants .
while hong kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares , salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party . salomon will `` cover '' the warrants by buying sufficient shares , or options to purchase shares , to cover its entire position .
bankers said warrants for hong kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors , wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market , an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk .
the hong kong telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in europe , the bankers added , because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the hong kong market that has international appeal .
financial corp. of santa barbara filed suit against former stock unk ivan f. boesky and drexel burnham lambert inc. , charging they unk the thrift by unk their relationship when unk it to buy $ unk million in high-yield , high-risk junk bonds .
in a suit filed in federal court thursday , the s&l alleged that a `` disproportionate number '' of the bonds it purchased in 1984 declined in value . financial corp. purchased the bonds , the suit alleged , after mr. boesky and drexel negotiated an agreement for unk hotels to purchase a 51 % stake in the thrift for about $ 34 million .
unk hotels was controlled by mr. boesky , who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations . officials at drexel said they had n't seen the suit and thus could n't comment .
in addition to $ 33 million unk damages , the suit seeks $ 100 million in punitive damages .
also named in the suit is ivan f. boesky corp. and unk corp. , the successor company to unk hotels . unk officials could n't be located .
financial corp. said it agreed to buy the bonds after a representative of ivan f. boesky corp. visited it in november 1983 and said financial corp. could improve its financial condition by purchasing the bonds . shortly before the visit , mr. boesky and drexel unk had met with financial corp. officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the 51 % stake in the company . however , the agreement was canceled in june 1984 .
financial corp. purchased the bonds in at least 70 different transactions in 1984 and since then has realized $ 11 million in losses on them , the company said .
ideal basic industries inc. said its directors reached an agreement in principle calling for unk north america inc. to combine its north american cement holdings with ideal in a transaction that will leave ideal 's minority shareholders with unk % of the combined company .
unk , the north american holding company of swiss concern unk financiere unk ltd. , previously proposed combining its 100 % stake in st. lawrence cement inc. and its 60 % stake in unk cement co. with its 67 % stake in ideal .
but unk 's first offer would have given ideal 's other shareholders about 10 % of the combined company . ideal 's directors rejected that offer , although they said they endorsed the merger proposal .
under the agreement , unk will own unk % of the combined company . ideal 's current operations will represent about unk % of the combined company .
the transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by ideal shareholders . ideal said it expects to complete the transaction early next year .
while corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their unk unk of 1988 , wheat prices remain unk high . and they 're likely to stay that way for months to come , analysts say .
for one thing , even with many farmers unk more winter wheat this year than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts say . and if rain does n't fall soon across many of the great plains ' unk areas , yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced , further unk supplies . also supporting prices are expectations that the soviet union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months .
by next may 31 , stocks of u.s. wheat to be carried over into the next season -- before the winter wheat now being planted is unk -- are projected to drop to unk million unk . that would be the lowest level since the early 1970s . stocks were unk million unk on may 31 of this year .
in response to unk domestic supplies , agriculture secretary unk yeutter last month said the u.s. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments . the government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million unk . it now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion unk , compared with this year 's estimated unk billion and a unk unk billion in 1988 .
but the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year . until then , limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ unk level , analysts say . on the chicago board of trade friday , wheat for december delivery settled at $ unk a bushel , unchanged .
in theory at least , tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market unk to a unk squeeze , said daniel unk , a futures analyst with unk co. in chicago . such a situation can unk unk , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the chicago board of trade .
in july , the unk ordered unk unk s.p . a. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million unk of soybeans . the exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their unk obligation to the italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings . unk has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market .
unk hot , dry weather across large portions of the great plains and in unk areas in washington and oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop , said unk unk , a futures analyst and head of unk analytical in chicago . for example , in the oklahoma unk , 40 % or more of the unk is short of unk . that figure unk to about 47 % in unk portions of kansas , he said .
the soviet union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many analysts expect moscow to place sizable orders for u.s. wheat in the next few months , further supporting prices . `` wheat prices will increasingly unk off of soviet demand '' in coming weeks , predicted richard unk , vice president , research , for unk inc. in chicago .
looking ahead to other commodity markets this week :
orange unk
traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began friday will go .
late thursday , after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have been a bullish u.s. department of agriculture estimate of the unk florida orange crop . it was near the low range of estimates , at 130 million unk boxes , compared with unk million boxes last season .
however , as expected , brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its unk concentrate to about $ unk a pound from around $ 1.55 . friday 's unk selling of futures contracts unk whatever supportive effect the u.s. report might have had and sent the november orange unk contract down as much as unk cents a pound at one time . it settled with a loss of unk cents at $ unk a pound .
brazilian unk , after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season , is beginning to arrive in the u.s. in large quantities . brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product , which is going to be in unk supply .
the price cut , one analyst said , appeared to be aimed even more at europe , where consumption of brazilian unk has fallen . it 's a unk product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in europe , the analyst said .
new york futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ 2 a pound at unk . barring a cold unk or other crop problems in the growing areas , downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into january , when unk and processing of unk in florida reach their peak , the analyst said .
energy
although some analysts look for profit-taking in the wake of friday 's leap in crude oil prices , last week 's rally is generally expected to continue this week .
`` i would continue to look for a stable crude market , at least in futures '' trading , said william unk , an energy futures broker with unk & co .
friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets . on the new york mercantile exchange , west texas intermediate crude for november delivery finished at $ unk a barrel , up 42 cents on the day . on european markets , meanwhile , spot prices of north sea unk were up 35 to 75 cents a barrel .
`` this market still wants to go higher , '' said unk unk , a first vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc . he predicted that the november contract will reach $ unk a barrel or more on the new york mercantile exchange .
there has been little news to account for such unk in the oil markets . analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and unk . there also are unk reports that the soviet union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that unk has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell . many traders unk a tightening of near-term supplies , particularly of high-quality unk such as those produced in the north sea and in unk .
if a hostile unk emerges for saatchi & saatchi co. , unk charles and maurice saatchi will lead a management buy-out attempt , an official close to the company said .
financing for any takeover attempt may be unk in the wake of friday 's stock-market sell-off in new york and turmoil in the junk-bond market . but the beleaguered british advertising and consulting giant , which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace maurice saatchi , has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks .
last week , saatchi 's largest shareholder , unk asset management , said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring . and carl spielvogel , chief executive officer of saatchi 's big backer spielvogel bates advertising unit , said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company , but was rebuffed by charles saatchi . mr. spielvogel said he would n't launch a hostile bid .
the executive close to saatchi & saatchi said that `` if a bidder came up with a unk high offer , a crazy offer which saatchi knew it could n't beat , it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders . but { otherwise } it would unk come back '' with an offer by management . the executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board , whose chairman is maurice saatchi and whose strategic unk force is believed to be charles saatchi . mr. spielvogel is n't part of the board , nor are any of the other heads of saatchi 's big unk ad agencies .
the executive did n't name any price , but securities analysts have said saatchi would fetch upward of $ 1.3 billion .
the executive denied speculation that saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back . that speculation unk friday as industry executives unk the appointment of the new chief executive , robert unk , who joins saatchi and becomes a member of its board on jan. 1 . mr. unk , formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm unk international inc. , has a reputation as a unk financial manager , and will be charged largely with unk saatchi 's poor financial state .
asked about the speculation that mr. unk has been hired to unk the way for a buy-out by the brothers , the executive replied , `` that is n't the reason dreyfus has been brought in . he was brought in to turn around the company . ''
separately , several saatchi agency clients said they believe the company 's management unk will have little affect on them .
`` it has n't had any impact on us , nor do we expect it to , '' said a spokeswoman for miller brewing co. , a major client of backer spielvogel . john unk , director of advertising at painewebber inc. , a saatchi & saatchi advertising client , said : `` we have no problem with the announcement , because we do n't know what change it 's going to bring about . we are n't going to change agencies because of a change in london . ''
executives at backer spielvogel client unk inc. , as well as at saatchi client philips lighting co. , also said they saw no effect . executives at prudential-bache securities inc. , a backer spielvogel client that is reviewing its account , declined comment . mr. spielvogel had said that prudential-bache was prepared to finance either a management buy-out and restructuring , or a buy-out of backer spielvogel alone , led by him .

in the year ended aug. 31 , 1988 , unk earned $ 2.9 million , or 72 cents a share , on sales of $ unk million .

'' the unk company added that it plans to `` unk its other defenses '' against unk 's lawsuit , including the claim that it has n't unk on unk 's patent .
unk said that the court scheduled a conference for next monday -- to set a date for proceedings on unk 's motion for a preliminary injunction .
newspaper publishers are reporting mixed third-quarter results , aided by favorable newsprint prices and hampered by flat or declining advertising unk , especially in the northeast .
adding to unk in the industry , seasonal retail ad spending patterns in newspapers have been upset by shifts in ownership and general unk within the retail industry . in new york , the unk teller and b. altman & co. department stores have filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code , while the unk macy & co. , bloomingdale 's and saks fifth avenue department-store chains are for sale .
many papers throughout the country are also faced with a slowdown in unk spending , a booming category for newspapers in recent years .
until recently , industry analysts believed unk in retail ad spending had unk out and would in fact increase in this year 's third and fourth quarters . all unk are off , analysts say , because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains .
`` improved paper prices will help offset weakness in unk , but the retailers ' problems have affected the amount of ad unk they usually run , '' said edward j. unk , industry analyst for salomon brothers inc . `` retailers are just in disarray . ''
for instance , unk co. posted an 11 % gain in net income , as total ad pages dropped at usa today , but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates . unk 's 83 daily and 35 unk newspapers reported a 3 % increase in advertising and circulation revenue . total advertising unk was `` modestly '' lower as unk volume increased , while there was `` softer demand '' for retail and national ad unk , said john unk , unk 's chief executive officer .
at usa today , ad pages totaled unk for the quarter , down 9.2 % from the 1988 period , which was helped by increased ad spending from the summer olympics . while usa today 's total paid ad pages for the year to date totaled unk , a decrease of 4 % from last year , the paper 's ad revenue increased 8 % in the quarter and 13 % in the nine months . in the nine months , unk 's net rose 9.5 % to $ 270 million , or $ unk a share , from $ unk million , or $ unk a share . revenue gained 6 % to $ unk billion from $ 2.4 billion .
at dow jones & co. , third-quarter net income fell 9.9 % from the year-earlier period . net fell to $ unk million , or 29 cents a share , from $ 32 million , or 33 cents a share . the year-earlier period included a one-time gain of $ 3.5 million , or four cents a share . revenue gained 5.3 % to $ unk million from $ unk million .
the drop in profit reflected , in part , continued softness in financial advertising at the wall street journal and barron 's magazine . ad unk at the journal fell 6.1 % in the third quarter .
affiliated publications inc. reversed a year-earlier third quarter net loss . the publisher of the boston globe reported net of $ 8.5 million , or 12 cents a share , compared with a loss of $ unk million , or 38 cents a share , for the third quarter in 1988 .
william o. taylor , the parent 's chairman and chief executive officer , said earnings continued to be hurt by softness in ad volume at the boston newspaper .
third-quarter profit estimates for several companies are being strongly affected by the price of newsprint , which in the last two years has had several price increases . after a supply crunch caused prices to rise 14 % since 1986 to $ 650 a metric ton , analysts are encouraged , because they do n't expect a price increase for the rest of this year .
companies with daily newspapers in the northeast will need the stable newsprint prices to ease damage from weak ad unk . mr. unk at salomon brothers said he estimates that times mirror co. 's earnings were down for the third quarter , because of soft advertising levels at its long island unk and hartford unk newspapers . trouble on the east coast was likely offset by improved ad unk at the los angeles times , which this week also unveiled a unk .
new york times co. is expected to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship new york times and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate , forest products group .
`` times co. 's regional daily newspapers are holding up well , but there is little sign that things will improve in the new york market , '' said alan unk , an analyst with shearson lehman hutton .
washington post co. is expected to report improved earnings , largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the washington area . according to analysts , profits were also helped by successful cost-cutting measures at newsweek . the unk has faced heightened competition from rival time magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market .
knight-ridder inc. is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its detroit free press and unk 's detroit news , and has told analysts that earnings were down in the third quarter . however , analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers , such as the miami herald and san jose mercury news .
`` the miami market is coming back strong after a tough couple of years '' when knight-ridder `` was starting up a hispanic edition and circulation was falling , '' said bruce unk , an analyst for unk national bank .
general motors corp. , in a series of moves that angered union officials in the u.s. and canada , has signaled that as many as five north american assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation unk to cut its excess unk capacity .
in announcements to workers late last week , gm effectively signed death unk for two unk van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the futures of three u.s. car factories .
gm is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's u.s. market share skidded during the past decade . the company , currently using about 80 % of its north american vehicle capacity , has vowed it will run at 100 % of capacity by 1992 . just a month ago , gm announced it would make an aging assembly plant in unk , ga. , the eighth u.s. assembly facility to close since 1987 .
now , gm appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s . one reason is mounting competition from new japanese car plants in the u.s. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than gm can match . another is that united auto workers union officials have signaled they want tighter unk provisions in the new big three national contract that will be negotiated next year . gm officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin .
the problem , however , is that gm 's moves are coming at a time when unk leaders are trying to unk unk who charge the union is too passive in the face of gm layoffs . against that unk , unk vice president stephen p. unk , who recently became head of the union 's gm department , issued a statement friday unk gm 's `` unk unk '' toward union members . the auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest unk and product unk unk out in separate unk to the affected plants showed `` disarray '' and an `` inability or unk to provide consistent information , '' mr. unk said .
gm officials told workers late last week of the following moves :
production of unk vans will be consolidated into a single plant in unk , mich . that means two plants -- one in unk , ontario , and the other in unk , ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991 . the unk will idle about 3,000 canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in ohio . robert white , canadian auto workers union president , used the impending unk shutdown to unk the unk free trade agreement and its champion , prime minister brian unk .
but canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate gm move that unk three u.s. car plants and one in quebec .
workers at plants in van unk , calif. , oklahoma city and unk , mich. , were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the unk unk and chevrolet unk muscle cars . gm is studying whether it can build the new unk unk at a plant in st. unk , quebec , company and union officials said .
that announcement left union officials in van unk and oklahoma city uncertain about their futures . the van unk plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 . jerry unk , unk local president , said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` unk plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand .
at the oklahoma city plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the unk unk unk cars , steve unk , unk local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the unk cars will die . he said he believes gm has plans to keep building unk cars into the mid-1990s .
at unk , however , the unk decision appears to unk unk hopes that gm would reopen the unk assembly plant that last built the unk , unk unk unk model .
the unk plant was viewed as a model of unk cooperation at gm before slow sales of the unk forced the company to close the factory last year . union officials have taken a beating politically as a result . dissident unk members have used the unk plant as a symbol of labor-management cooperation 's failure .
institut merieux s.a. of france said the canadian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of connaught unk inc. for unk million canadian dollars ( us$ unk million ) .
merieux said the government 's minister of industry , science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of `` net benefit '' to canada . canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard .
the french company said the government gave it 30 days in which to submit information to further support its takeover plan .
both merieux and connaught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns .
the government 's action was unusual . alan unk , executive vice president of investment canada , which oversees foreign takeovers , said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse unk decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company . he said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns , but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed .
`` this is n't a change in government policy ; this provision has been used before , '' said unk redmond , press secretary for unk unk , canada 's minister of industry , science and technology . mr. unk issued the ruling based on a recommendation by investment canada .
spokesmen for merieux and connaught said they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or investment canada , but added they hope to have more information early this week .
investment canada declined to comment on the reasons for the government decision .
unk unk , a partner with unk & unk , a new york-based pharmaceutical industry research firm , said the government 's ruling was n't unexpected .
`` this has become a very unk deal , concerning canada 's only large , unk unk or pharmaceutical company , '' mr. unk said .
mr. unk said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an unk settlement of connaught 's dispute with the university of toronto . the university is seeking to block the acquisition of connaught by foreign interests , citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in canada .
the university is considering a settlement proposal made by connaught . while neither side will disclose its unk , mr. unk expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in canada than merieux offered to investment canada .
some analysts , such as murray unk of toronto-based unk unk inc. , believe the government ruling leaves the door open for other bidders , such as switzerland 's ciba-geigy and chiron corp. of unk , calif . officials for the two concerns , which are bidding c$ 30 a share for connaught , could n't be reached for comment .
french state-owned unk s.a. holds 51 % of merieux .
unk international inc. said it canceled plans for a unk swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock , and added that it expects to publicly offer about 10 million common shares .
the company said it planned to offer an unk number of common shares in exchange for the unk shares of its preferred stock outstanding . the exchange ratio was never established . unk said market conditions led to the unk of the planned exchange .
the unk concern said , however , that in january 1990 , it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock . unk suspended its unk payment in october 1985 and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in unk about $ 6 million , but will do so some time in the future .
additionally , the company said it filed with the securities and exchange commission for the proposed offering of 10 million shares of common stock , expected to be offered in november .
the company said salomon brothers inc. and howard , weil , unk , unk inc. , underwriters for the offering , were granted an option to buy as much as an additional 1.5 million shares to cover unk . proceeds will be used to eliminate and restructure bank debt . unk currently has approximately unk million common shares outstanding .
earnings for most of the nation 's major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead unk in the third quarter , as companies with newer , unk prescription drugs fared especially well .
for the third consecutive quarter , however , most of the companies ' revenues were battered by adverse foreign-currency unk as a result of the strong dollar abroad .
analysts said that merck & co. , eli lilly & co. , warner-lambert co. and the squibb corp. unit of bristol-myers squibb co. all benefited from strong sales of relatively new , unk unk that provide wide profit margins . less robust earnings at pfizer inc. and upjohn co. were attributed to those companies ' older products , many of which face unk competition from generic drugs and other unk .
joseph unk , an analyst with bear , stearns & co. , said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their unk businesses and instituted other cost savings , such as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs . as a result , `` major new products are having significant impact , even on a company with very large revenues , '' mr. unk said .
analysts said profit for the dozen or so big drug makers , as a group , is estimated to have climbed between 11 % and 14 % . while that 's not spectacular , neil unk , an analyst with prudential unk , said that the rate of growth will `` look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward . ''
mr. unk estimated that merck 's profit for the quarter rose by about 22 % , propelled by sales of its unk of fast-growing prescription drugs , including its unk drug , unk ; a high blood pressure medicine , unk ; unk , an unk , and unk , an unk medication . profit climbed even though merck 's sales were reduced by `` one to three percentage points '' as a result of the strong dollar , mr. unk said . in the third quarter of 1988 , merck earned $ unk million , or 79 cents a share .
in unk , n.j. , a merck spokesman said the company does n't make earnings projections .
mr. unk said he estimated that lilly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about 20 % , largely because of the performance of its new unk unk . the drug , introduced last year , is expected to generate sales of about $ 300 million this year . `` it 's turning out to be a real blockbuster , '' mr. unk said .
in last year 's third quarter , lilly earned $ unk million , or $ 1.20 a share . in indianapolis , lilly declined comment .
several analysts said they expected warner-lambert 's profit also to increase by more than 20 % from $ unk million , or $ 1.25 a share , it reported in the like period last year . the company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit margins . the company 's lean operation , analysts said , allowed unk sales from its cholesterol drug , unk , to power earnings growth . unk sales are expected to be about $ 300 million this year , up from $ 190 million in 1988 . in morris plains , n.j. , a spokesman for the company said the analysts ' projections are `` in the unk . ''
squibb 's profit , estimated by analysts to be about 18 % above the $ unk million , or $ 1.25 a share , it earned in the third quarter of 1988 , was the result of especially strong sales of its unk drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease . the company was officially merged with bristol-myers co. earlier this month . bristol-myers declined to comment .
mr. unk of bear stearns said that schering-plough corp. 's expected profit rise of about 18 % to 20 % , and unk 's expected profit increase of about 13 % are largely because `` those companies are really managed well . '' unk earned $ unk million , or 84 cents a share , while bristol-myers earned $ unk million , or 81 cents a share , in the like period a year earlier .
in madison , n.j. , a spokesman for schering-plough said the company has `` no problems '' with the average estimate by a analysts that third-quarter earnings per share rose by about 19 % , to $ 1 . the company expects to achieve the 20 % increase in full-year earnings per share , as it projected in the spring , the spokesman said .
meanwhile , analysts said pfizer 's recent string of lackluster quarterly performances continued , as earnings in the quarter were expected to decline by about 5 % . sales of pfizer 's important drugs , unk for treating unk , and unk , a heart medicine , have unk because of increased competition . `` the ( strong ) dollar hurt pfizer a lot , too , '' mr. unk said . in the third quarter last year , pfizer earned $ unk million , or $ 1.29 a share . in new york , the company declined comment .
analysts said they expected upjohn 's profit to be flat or rise by only about 2 % to 4 % as compared with $ unk million , or 49 cents a share , it earned a year ago . upjohn 's unk drugs are unk , a unk , and unk , a unk .
sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws unk the unk of certain unk unk and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs . also , the company 's unk drug , unk , is selling well -- at about $ 125 million for the year , but the company 's profit from the drug has been reduced by upjohn 's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising , analysts said . in unk , mich. , upjohn declined comment .
amid a crowd of unk stocks , unk technology inc. 's stock fell particularly hard friday , dropping 23 % because its problems were compounded by disclosure of an unexpected loss for its fiscal first quarter .
the unk software company said it expects a $ 2 million net loss for the fiscal first quarter ended sept. 30 . it said analysts had been expecting a small profit for the period . revenue is expected to be `` up modestly '' from the $ unk million reported a year ago . unk technology reported net income of $ 1.5 million , or 12 cents a share , in the year-earlier period .
`` while our international operations showed strong growth , our domestic business was substantially below expectations , '' said paul unk , president and chief executive officer . a spokesman said the company 's first quarter is historically soft , and computer companies in general are experiencing slower sales .
mr. unk said he accepted the resignation of thomas wilson , vice president of corporate sales , and that his marketing responsibilities have been unk . the company said mr. wilson 's resignation was n't related to the sales unk .
unk technology went public in may 1988 at $ 14 a share . it fell $ 1.875 a share friday , to $ 6.25 , a new low , in over-the-counter trading . its high for the past year was $ unk a share .
in the previous quarter , the company earned $ 4.5 million , or 37 cents a share , on sales of $ unk million .
the bronx has a wonderful unk garden , a great unk , its own unk little italy ( on arthur avenue ) and , of course , the unk . however , most people , having been unk to news unk of the unk south bronx , look at the borough the way tom unk 's sherman unk did in `` unk of the unk '' -- as a wrong turn into hell .
but unk unk 's bronx , her unk bronx of the unk , is something else altogether . in a lovely , unk unk , `` sleeping arrangements '' ( unk , unk pages , $ 18.95 ) , she unk an exotic unk , unk mainly by jewish unk and the unk catholic ( real unk like her unk friend , the unk unk , age five ) .
ms. unk , a unk and playwright , has a unk and dramatically unk sense of recall . she unk her `` bronx of the unk , a place where the unk of unk are only relieved by steep unk into unk '' into the `` unk bronx , '' a world unk with sex and death and unk . in the unk bronx , jewish unk people lived in unk , unk buildings `` unk '' with names like unk towers ( after owners unk and morris unk ) , whose unk and unk were unk with unk of ancient unk and unk , unk of unk .
for ms. unk the architectural unk matched the unk she felt living in the unk towers as a little girl : `` ... unk ordinary , unk unk , unk all unk to unk unk . '' unk and funny but never mean , she 's a unk a bit like unk unk , if he 'd been jewish and female and less unk .
little unk , as ms. unk calls herself in the book , really was n't ordinary . she was raised , for the first eight years , by her mother , unk , whom she unk as a unk unk , who unk history to explain why unk 's father did n't live with them . unk unk this man , who may or may not have known about his child , as a war hero for unk 's benefit .
unk died young and unk has remembered her as a romantic figure , who did n't interfere much with her child 's education on the streets . the games bronx children played ( holding kids down and unk them , for example ) seem unk by today 's crack standards , but ms. unk makes it all sound like a great unk . `` without official knowledge of sex or death , we unk with both , '' she writes . she unk families by their sleeping arrangements . her friend susan , whose parents kept unk her she was unwanted , unk on a narrow bed unk into her parents ' unk , as though she were a temporary unk . her friend unk 's father was a professional thief ; they did n't seem to have any unk at all .
maybe unk became so unk with where people unk and how because her own arrangements kept shifting . when unk died , her unk moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements . they painted the apartment orange , unk and white , according to her instructions . with unk detail she recalls her uncle unk , an orthodox unk and song unk ( who unk river with unk in a love song ) ; and uncle unk , a unk unk investigator who looked like lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a manila unk , like an `` unk president on a unk mission . ''
they came by their unk unk . unk 's unk , no unk baker , unk the heads of unk unk from the family unk , and unk around her unk unk , `` philosophy for women . ''
the book loses some momentum toward the end , when unk becomes more unk with dating boys and less with her unk weird family . for the most part , though , there 's much pleasure in her unk , unk probe into the unk of the unk bronx .
the bronx also figures in bruce jay friedman 's latest novel , which unk back to the new york of the unk . but both the past and present unk of `` the current climate '' ( atlantic monthly press , 200 pages , $ 18.95 ) feel unk and unk .
for his sixth novel , mr. friedman tried to unk the unk of his 1972 work , `` about harry towns . '' harry is now a 57-year-old writer , whose continuing unk with drugs and marginal types in hollywood and new york seems unk unk . harry unk unk the `` old '' days of the early unk , when people like his friend unk would take a unk on a date to analyze what unk was doing wrong . `` an l.a. solution , '' explains mr. friedman .
line by line mr. friedman 's unk unk can be amusing , especially when he 's unk on the hollywood social scheme -- the way people size each other up , immediately unk the desperate ones who merely almost made it . harry has avoided all that by living in a long island suburb with his wife , who 's so unk to soap unk and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for unk unk into manhattan .
but it does n't take too many lines to figure harry out . he 's a unk .
gulf resources & chemical corp. said it agreed to pay $ 1.5 million as part of an accord with the environmental protection agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a unk unk the company formerly operated in idaho .
in 1984 the epa notified gulf resources , which was a unk of the unk , that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal superfund program . the unk area is contaminated with lead , unk and other metals .
gulf resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a unk concern , potentially unk it from liability for the unk 's cleanup costs . the company said that as part of its agreement with the epa , it `` made certain voluntary unk with respect to unk transactions entered into after the reorganization . '' the company , which issued a statement on the agreement late friday , said that $ 1 million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $ 500,000 will be recognized in its 1989 third-quarter statement . the agreement and consent unk are subject to court approval , the company said .
gulf resources added that it `` will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the superfund law . ''
under the agreement , gulf must give the u.s. government 45 days ' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock . the company 's net worth can not fall below $ 185 million after the dividends are issued . `` the terms of that agreement only become effective the date of gulf 's reorganization , which we anticipate will occur sometime in early 1990 , '' said lawrence r. mehl , gulf 's general counsel .
in addition , gulf must give the government 20 days ' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $ 50 million that are made to the unk holding company . gulf 's net worth after those transaction must be at least $ 150 million . separately , the company said it expects to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early 1990 to vote on its proposed reorganization .
many of the nation 's unk executives unk friday 's market plunge as an overdue unk for speculators and takeover players .
assuming that the market does n't head into a unk free fall , some executives think friday 's action could prove a unk of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be unk . `` this is a reaction to unk lbo unk , rather than to any fundamentals , '' said john young , chairman of hewlett-packard co. , whose shares dropped $ unk to $ unk . `` if we get rid of a lot of that unk , it will be a big plus . ''
a few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the business council , a group that meets to discuss national issues , were only too happy to unk their criticism . `` people wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs , do something about takeovers , do something about donald trump , '' said rand unk , chairman of itt corp. , whose stock dropped $ unk . `` where 's the leadership ? where 's the guy who can say : ` enough is enough ' '' ?
the executives were unk unk by the plunge even though it unk billions of dollars off the value of their companies -- and millions off their personal fortunes .
`` i 'm not going to worry about one day 's decline , '' said kenneth unk , digital equipment corp. president , who was unk unk through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the unk here after his company 's shares plunged $ unk to close at $ unk . `` i did n't bother calling anybody ; i did n't even turn on tv . ''
`` there has n't been any fundamental change in the economy , '' added john unk , whose procter & gamble co. took an $ 8.75 slide to close at $ unk . `` the fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this wo n't be a problem . ''
of course , established corporate unk often tend to unk the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists . indeed , one chief executive who was downright unk by friday 's events was robert unk , chairman of amr corp. , the parent of american airlines and the target of a takeover offer by mr. trump . asked whether friday 's action could help him avoid being unk by the new york real estate unk , mr. unk unk broadly and said : `` no comment . ''
on friday morning , before the market 's sell-off , the business leaders issued a report predicting the economy would grow at roughly an inflation-adjusted 2 % annual rate , through next year , then accelerate unk in 1991 . of the 19 economists who worked on the business council forecast , only two projected periods of decline in the nation 's output over the next two years , and in `` both unk the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession , '' said lewis unk , chairman of j.p. morgan & co. and vice chairman of the business council .
the real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of new york office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market .
in manhattan , unk store sites sit vacant and newly unk space has been slow to fill . retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that unk have not yet hit bottom .
`` there is an unk amount of space available , '' says faith unk , senior vice president at unk associates store leasing inc . there are about 2,000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of unk to 1,500 . `` this further unk retailers , '' she says . `` they wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down ? is this the wrong time to open a store ? who is going to be in the space next door ? ''
in addition , ms. unk says , tenants usually can negotiate to pay unk that are about unk lower than unk ' initial asking price .
a handful of hot retail locations , such as the unk street and madison and fifth avenue areas , have been able to sustain what many see as unk unk . and , in some neighborhoods , unk have merely hit a unk . but on average , manhattan retail unk have dropped 10 % to 15 % in the past six months alone , experts say . that follows a more unk decline in the prior six months , after manhattan unk had run up rapidly since 1986 .
the same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing . `` as businesses contract or unk , the number of employees who might use retail services unk , '' says edward a. friedman , senior vice president of helmsley unk inc .
he says financial problems unk electronics , fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further unk the market . hardest hit are what he calls `` secondary '' sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents . in these locations , mr. friedman says , `` retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and unk have remained steady or in some cases have declined . '' weakness in the restaurant industry , which is leaving retail space vacant , unk the problem for unk .
it is also no comfort to unk and small new york retailers when the future of larger department stores , which unk retail neighborhoods , are in doubt . hooker corp. , parent of unk teller and b. altman 's , is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and bloomingdale 's is for sale by its owner , campeau corp .
the trend toward lower unk may seem surprising given that some communities in new york are unk the loss of favorite local businesses to high unk . but , despite the recent softening , for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s , when their leases were signed .
certainly , the recent drop in prices does n't mean manhattan comes cheap . new york retail unk still run well above the going rate in other u.s. cities . madison and fifth unk and east unk street can command unk of up to $ 500 a square foot , and $ 250 is not uncommon . the thriving unk street area offers unk of about $ 100 a square foot , as do unk locations along lower fifth avenue . by contrast , unk in the best retail locations in boston , san francisco and chicago rarely top $ 100 a square foot . and unk on beverly hills ' unk drive generally do n't exceed about $ 125 a square foot .

when justice william unk marks the start of his unk year on the supreme court today , the occasion will differ sharply from previous unk of his tenure .
for the first time , the unk justice finds his influence almost exclusively in unk , rather than as a force in the high court 's majority . this role reversal holds true , as well , for his three liberal and moderate allies , justices unk marshall , harry unk and john stevens .
but are these four players , three of them in their unk , ready to assume a different role after 88 years , unk , of service on the high court ?
every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role , and the unk that go with it , but in different ways . justices unk and stevens appear unk about it ; justices marshall and unk appear fighting unk .
the four justices are no newcomers to unk , often joining forces in the past decade to unk the court 's conservative unk . but always , in years past , they have unk the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to unk out a number of major victories in civil rights and unk cases . now , however , as the court 's new unk conservative majority continues to unk , victories for the liberals are rare .
the change is most dramatic for justice unk , the last unk of the unk liberal majority under chief justice unk warren . in the seven supreme court terms from the fall of unk through the spring of 1967 , the unk of the warren court 's power , justice unk cast only 25 unk votes in unk cases decided by the court . last term alone he cast 52 unk votes in unk decisions , with the contentious unk ruling as his only big victory .
but justice unk unk his new role , strongly defending the importance of unk in a 1985 speech . `` each time the court unk an issue , the justices will be forced by a unk to reconsider the fundamental questions and to unk the result , '' he said . moreover , in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s , he knew that the tables might turn in the future . he has said that he now knows how justice john unk felt , a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent unk from the warren court 's opinions .
associates of unk justice marshall say he was `` depressed '' about the court 's direction last spring , but is unk about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights . `` we could sweep it under the unk and hide it , but i 'm not going to do it , '' he said in a speech last month .
he , like justice unk , considers unk highly important for the future , a point that has n't escaped legal scholars . harvard law school professor laurence tribe says there is a `` unk '' flavor to current unk . the unk in the warren court , he says , appeared to be writing for the short-term , suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon . `` unk and marshall are speaking in their unk to a more distant future , '' he says .
justice unk , who will turn 81 next month , also seems unk about his new role . associates say he takes some unk more personally than his colleagues , especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his 1973 opinion , roe vs. wade .
friends and associates who saw justice unk during the summer said he was no more unk about the court than in recent years . and his outlook improved after successful unk surgery in august .
but his level of frustration showed in a recent , unk speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in chicago . he concluded his remarks by unk , unk and at some length , according to those present , the late martin unk king 's famous `` i have a dream '' speech from the 1963 march on washington .
justice stevens , 69 , is probably the most unk of the unk about his role , in part because he may be the least liberal of the four , but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others .
if the role these four unk are assuming is a familiar one in modern supreme court history , it also unk in an important way from recent history , court watchers say . `` the unk of the warren court were often defending a legal unk that they inherited , '' says prof. unk dick howard of the university of virginia law school , `` but the unk today are defending a unk that they created . ''
the government sold the deposits of four savings-and-loan institutions , in its first wave of sales of big , sick thrifts , but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth .
the four s&ls were sold to large banks , as was the case with most of the 28 previous transactions initiated by the resolution trust corp. since it was created in the s&l bailout legislation two months ago .
two of the four big thrifts were sold to ncnb corp. , charlotte , n.c. , which has aggressively expanded its markets , particularly in texas and florida . a canadian bank bought another thrift , in the first rtc transaction with a foreign bank .
under these deals , the rtc sells just the deposits and the healthy assets . these `` unk '' transactions leave the bulk of bad assets , mostly real estate , with the government , to be sold later . in these four , for instance , the rtc is stuck with $ unk billion in bad assets . unk paid premiums ranging from 1.5 % to 3.7 % for the deposits and branch systems , roughly in line with what analysts were expecting .
the buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks , as has been the case with previous deals . after that , the buyers may unk the rates paid by the former thrifts . but it 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps . ncnb , for example , has been one of the highest rate unk in the texas market , and in florida , rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities .
the rtc had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines , but the delays illustrate the tough unk facing the agency . `` these thrifts are unk unk , '' said unk unk , an industry consultant based in unk , va . for example , the delay in selling people 's heritage savings , unk , unk , with $ 1.7 billion in assets , has forced the rtc to consider selling off the thrift unk , instead of as a whole institution .
ncnb continued its unk into the florida and texas markets . ncnb will acquire university federal savings association , houston , which had assets of $ 2.8 billion . ncnb texas national bank will pay the rtc a premium of $ unk million for $ 3.5 billion in deposits . as a measure of the unk to which the texas real estate market has unk , the rtc will pay $ 3.8 billion to ncnb to take $ 750 million of bad assets .
ncnb also acquired freedom savings & loan association , unk , fla. , which had total assets of $ 900 million . ncnb will pay the rtc a premium of $ unk million for $ 1.1 billion in deposits . ncnb will also acquire $ unk million of freedom 's assets from the rtc , which will require $ unk million in assistance .
meridian bancorp inc. , reading , pa. , will acquire hill financial savings association , red hill , pa. , which had $ 2.3 billion in assets . meridian will pay a premium of $ unk million to assume $ 2 billion in deposits . it will also purchase $ unk million of the thrift 's assets , with $ 1.9 billion in rtc assistance .
in the first rtc transaction with a foreign buyer , royal unk ltd. , toronto , will acquire pacific savings bank , costa mesa , calif. , which had $ unk million in assets . royal unk will pay the rtc $ 25 million to assume $ unk million in deposits . it will also purchase $ unk million in assets , and receive $ 550 million in assistance from the rtc .

time magazine , in a move to reduce the costs of unk new subscribers , is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year , increasing its unk rates and cutting back on merchandise unk .
in an announcement to its staff last week , executives at time warner inc. 's weekly magazine said time will `` dramatically unk '' its use of electronic unk such as unk in television unk drives ; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000 , to four million ; and increase the cost of its annual unk rate by about $ 4 to $ 55 .
in a related development , the unk , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , unk page in the magazine costs about $ unk . however , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to richard unk , time associate publisher .
time is following the course of some other unk magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing unk that maintaining unk high , and expensive , unk is the way to draw advertisers . in recent years , reader 's digest , new york times co. 's mccall 's , and most recently news corp. 's tv guide , have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers .
deep discounts in unk and offers of free clock unk and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the unk world of magazine unk . but time , as part of the more unk time warner , wants to unk itself away from expensive unk . besides , time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is unk . `` unk just give people the wrong image , '' said mr. unk . `` that perception takes the focus off the magazine . ''
time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers . `` what we are doing is unk out the readers who are only unk related to the magazine and do n't really read it , '' said mr. unk . `` we are trying to create quality and involvement . ''
however , time executives used the same explanation when in october 1988 the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from 4.6 million to 4.3 million . and time 's paid circulation , according to audit bureau of unk , dropped 7.3 % to unk in the six months ended june 30 , 1989 .
still , time 's move is being received well , once again . `` it 's unk for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more , '' said michael unk , national media director at unk inc. ad agency . `` a few drops in circulation are of no consequence . it 's not a show of weakness ; they are improving the quality of circulation while unk their profits . ''
mr. unk said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry : a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber , or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away . `` the question is how much are we getting from each reader , '' said mr. unk .
time 's rivals unk , washington post co. 's newsweek and u.s. news & world report , are less unk on electronic unk , and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases . both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for 1990 within a month .
when the news broke of an attempted coup in panama two weeks ago , sen. christopher unk called the state department for a briefing . `` they said , ` follow unk , ' '' he told reporters .
that shows how far ted turner 's cable news network has come since its birth nine years ago , when it was considered the unk of television news . it is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks . its niche as the `` network of record '' during major crises draws unk audiences around the world .
but for all its success , unk has hit a unk . although unk unk when big news breaks , it unk during periods of calm . unk executives worry that the network 's unk but unk news unk may be getting unk and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives unk for news and information on cable-tv .
`` just the fact we 're on 24 hours is no longer unk , '' says ed turner , unk 's executive vice president , news gathering ( and no unk to ted turner ) . `` you ca n't live on that . ''
so unk , a unit of atlanta-based turner broadcasting system inc. , is trying to unk itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a `` top of mind '' network . tonight , to kick off the effort , unk will premiere its first prime-time unk in years , an unk show at 6 p.m . eastern time to air unk against the network unk . the show will be unk by bernard shaw and unk unk , a unk former texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism .
the new show is perhaps the unk in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current unk toward more unk `` signature '' programming with unk stars . to unk itself , unk is also expanding international coverage and adding a second unk program . it is paying higher salaries -- after years of unk -- to lure and keep experienced staffers . and it is unk on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large unk team .
`` the next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , '' says jon unk , executive vice president of headline news , unk 's sister network .
but that wo n't be easy . networks , like other consumer products , develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change . it also takes money that unk has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see . and the cable-tv operators -- unk 's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are .
the unk bid is aimed at unk 's unk unk -- and what may happen to it as the cable-tv news market grows more competitive . already , unk is facing stronger competition from financial news network inc. and general electric co. 's consumer news and business channel , both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future . in addition , many cable-tv systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations .
unk wants to change its viewers ' habits . its watchers are , on the whole , a unk group of unk `` unk '' and news unk , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching unk , according to audience research . that 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks . the brief attention viewers give unk could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-tv channels .
unk 's unk habits have been unk by its unk . its strategy in the past has been to serve as a tv wire service . it focused on building up its news bureaus around the world , so as events took place it could go live unk and longer than other networks . it filled its daily schedule with unk called `` unk , '' `` unk , '' `` unk , '' and `` unk , '' but the shows unk little in content , unk or look .
now , the push is on for unk shows . `` our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , '' says paul unk , unk executive vice president for programming .
unk , unk is adding a unk show in the morning because surveys show its unk hour in the afternoon is among its most `` unk '' programs in viewers ' minds , says mr. unk . and it is exploring other original programs , similar to its `` larry king live '' and `` unk '' talk shows , which executives hope will keep people unk in .
then there 's `` the world today , '' the prime-time unk featuring mr. shaw and ms. unk . until now , unk has featured its hollywood unk show during the key evening period . but 70 % of the unk households that watch news do so between unk p.m. and 7 p.m. , the network discovered , so unk wants in . mr. unk says the unk team will probably do two live interviews a day , with most of the program , at least for now , appearing similar to unk 's other unk .
some in the industry are skeptical . `` i find it hard to unk of people switching over to unk for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , '' says unk frank , the former unk president of nbc news and unk of the unk report .
the evening news is also slated as unk 's stage for its big push into unk journalism . in august , the network hired unk producer unk hill , the former head of news unk at abc . she 's unk a staff of about 35 unk reporters who will produce weekly , unk segments , with an eye toward breaking big stories . unk executives hope the unk created by such unk will generate excitement for its `` unk '' programs , in the way `` 60 minutes '' did so well for cbs .
that 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical unk will follow through with its unk commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing unk pieces . `` they 've never shown any unk to spend money on production , '' says michael unk , a senior producer with unk unk , who notes that unk is unk to his job .
the network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards , resulting in a unk work force . unk recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically unk compared with the networks . says mr. unk : `` unk is my wire service ; they 're on top of everything . but to improve , they 've really got to make the investment in people . ''
in any case , unk operators have reason to fear any unk with unk 's unk . they market cable-tv on the very unk opportunities unk seeks to discourage . `` we would obviously be upset if those kinds of services unk into more unk , unk programming , '' says robert unk , senior vice president , programming , of continental unk inc. , which holds a 2 % stake in turner broadcasting .

the second u.s. circuit court of appeals opinion in the unk unk case did not unk the position pennzoil co. took in its dispute with texaco , contrary to your sept. 8 article `` court backs texaco 's view in pennzoil case -- too late . ''
the fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound . in the unk litigation , the courts found pennzoil and unk oil intended to be bound ; in unk unk they found there was no intention to be bound .
unk , the principle in the cases is the same . but the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts . and the facts , as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits , were different .
when you suggest otherwise , you leave the unk of reporting and enter the unk of speculation .

valley federal savings & loan association said imperial corp. of america withdrew from regulators its application to buy five valley federal branches , leaving the transaction in limbo .
the broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at imperial corp. , whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal office of thrift supervision because of an informal notice that imperial 's thrift unit failed to meet community reinvestment act requirements .
the community reinvestment act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received .
the transaction , announced in august , included about $ unk million in deposits at the five outlets in california 's san unk valley . terms were n't disclosed , but valley federal had said it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $ 2 million in operating costs annually .
valley federal said friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with imperial corp. , which said it is attempting to meet community reinvestment act requirements .
valley federal , with assets of $ 3.3 billion , is based in van unk . imperial corp. , based in san diego , is the parent of imperial savings & loan . in the first six months of the year it posted a net loss of $ unk million .
call it the `` we 're too broke to fight '' defense .
lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new unk in their efforts to unk suits filed by borrowers , developers and creditors .
the thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits , unk 700 to 1,000 in texas alone , should be dismissed as unk because neither the s&ls nor the unk federal savings and loan insurance corp. has the money to pay judgments .
though the argument may have a unk ring to it , even the s&l lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their position .
still , one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to unk the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law .
the dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court unk in texas and reducing the unk 's massive legal bills , which topped $ 73 million last year .
the s&l lawyers were encouraged last month by an unk ruling in two cases brought against unk unk savings & loan association of dallas by the developers of the valley ranch , best known as the training center for the dallas cowboys football team . unk foreclosed on the ranch .
unk and the unk argued to the fifth u.s. circuit court of appeals `` that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against unk savings nor any means to collect from any other party , including unk . ''
`` if true , '' the court wrote , `` this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds . '' but the court said it lacked enough financial information about unk and the unk and sent the cases back to federal district court in dallas .
charles unk , a lawyer for unk , says he plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss the suits , because unk 's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $ 2 billion when federal regulators closed it in august 1988 .
`` this institution is just brain dead , '' says mr. unk , a partner in the dallas office of unk & unk , a houston law firm .
but a lawyer for unk investment group , the developer of valley ranch , unk such arguments as a `` defense du unk . '' attorney richard jackson of dallas says a judgment for unk could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award , including the reversal of unk 's unk on valley ranch .
`` we 're asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the unk of victory , '' he says . `` we 'd take the valley ranch free and clear as a unk prize . ''

september 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still unk , and the unk over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge friday .
after falling for three consecutive months , the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9 % last month , the labor department reported friday , as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer .
although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the dow jones industrial average , analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline . analysts immediately viewed the price data , the unk inflation news in months , as evidence that the federal reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped .
further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the fed from easing credit , the commerce department reported friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in september , to $ unk billion . that rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in august , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy .
`` i think the friday report , combined with the actions of the fed , weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy , '' said robert unk , chief economist at northern trust co. in chicago .
but economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers .
`` the overall 0.9 % increase is serious in itself , but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer price index still increased by 0.7 % , '' said gordon unk , an economist at the national association of manufacturers .
but sung won unk , chief economist at unk corp. in minneapolis , blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the september jump . `` i would say this is not bad news ; this is a unk , '' he said . `` the core rate is not really out of line . ''
all year , energy prices have unk the producer price index , which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods . inflation unk has fallen back from its unk pace last winter , when a steep unk in world oil prices sent the index unk at double-digit annual rates . energy prices then plummeted through the summer , causing the index to decline for three consecutive months .
overall , the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual rate since the start of the year , the labor department said . while far more unk than the pace at the beginning of the year , that is still a unk rise than the unk % increase for all of 1988 .
moreover , this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month , when energy prices unk up 6.5 % after plunging 7.3 % in august . some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead , leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain .
analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated . `` i think the unk { in inflation } is going to continue for a few months , '' said john unk , chief economist at bell unk unk , a washington economic forecasting firm . he predicted that inflation will moderate next year , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide .
but unk van unk , president of the national association of unk , said that last month 's rise `` is n't as bad an unk '' as the 0.9 % figure suggests . `` if you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained .
passenger car prices jumped 3.8 % in september , after climbing 0.5 % in august and declining in the late spring and summer . many analysts said the september increase was a one-time event , coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models . although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations , car prices rose beyond the unk autumn increase .
prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1 % in september , while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1 % . food prices declined 0.6 % , after climbing 0.3 % in august .
meanwhile , the retail sales report showed that car sales rose unk % in september to $ unk billion . but at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices , analysts said .
sales at general merchandise stores rose 1.7 % after declining 0.6 % in august , while sales of building materials fell 1.8 % after rising 1.7 % .
producer prices for intermediate goods grew 0.4 % in september , after dropping for three consecutive months . prices for crude goods , an array of raw materials , jumped 1.1 % after declining 1.9 % in august and unk up 0.2 % in july .
here are the labor department 's producer price indexes ( 1982 unk 100 ) for september , before seasonal adjustment , and the percentage changes from september , 1988 .
unk financial corp. said it expects to report a loss of at least $ 125 million to $ 150 million for the third quarter .
in the year-earlier period , unk had net income of $ unk , but no per-share earnings .
unk 's president and chief executive officer , john unk , said the loss stems from several factors . he said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $ 700 million from $ unk million between june and september . approximately 85 % of the total unk of nonperforming commercial real estate assets . unk , unk estimated that it will provide between $ 85 million and $ 110 million for credit losses in the third quarter .
unk added that significant additional loan-loss provisions may be required by federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of city federal savings bank , unk 's primary subsidiary , based in unk , n.j . city federal operates 105 banking offices in new jersey and florida .
mr. unk said unk will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions unk themselves of such bonds . that action , unk said , will result in a charge against third-quarter results of approximately $ 30 million .
unk also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan unk operations outside its principal markets in new jersey and florida and , as a result , is taking a charge for discontinued operations .
all these actions , mr. unk said , will result in a loss of $ 125 million to $ 150 million for the third quarter . he added , however : `` depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages unk and the outcome of the annual examination of city federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves , the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range . ''
unk savings bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock , indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened .
in a statement , miami-based unk said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and `` apparent losses '' in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends . regulators also ordered unk to stop buying back the preferred stock .
david l. paul , chairman and chief executive officer , criticized the federal office of thrift supervision , which issued the unk , saying it was `` inappropriate '' and based on `` insufficient '' reasons . he said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision .
the suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution 's health .
in march , regulators labeled unk a `` troubled institution , '' largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses . in the same month , the office of thrift supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track .
for the nine months ended june 30 , unk had a net loss of $ 21.3 million , compared with year-earlier net income of $ unk million . unk , which is florida 's largest thrift , holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation . since april , it has unk its high-yield bond holdings to about $ unk million from $ 1.35 billion . mr. paul said only about $ 150 million of the current holdings are unk securities registered with the securities and exchange commission . the remainder , he said , are commercial loan unk , or private unk , that are n't filed with the sec and do n't have a ready market .
unk and regulators have been in a dispute over market unk for the junk bonds . the office of thrift supervision has been unk unk to provide current market values for its holdings , but unk has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative unk of the bonds and lack of a ready market .
regulators have become increasingly unk about unk 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market . the legislation requires thrifts to unk themselves of junk bonds in the new , unk regulatory climate .
in american stock exchange composite trading friday , unk common shares closed at $ 3 , down 12.5 cents .
in a statement friday , mr. paul challenged the regulators ' decision , saying the thrift 's operating losses and `` apparent '' junk-bond losses `` have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank . '' he also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds . in the third quarter , for instance , unk added $ 22.5 million to its general reserves .
mr. paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with unk unk 's request to sell 63 of its 71 branches to great western bank , a unit of great western financial corp. based in beverly hills , calif .
the branch sale is the centerpiece of unk 's strategy to transform itself into a traditional s&l from a unk institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits , according to mr. paul . most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction , which was announced in july , long before now . many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal . branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution .
unk , however , unk the branch sale , saying it would bring in $ 150 million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ 6.7 billion from $ 9 billion . it said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ 82 million , or about 1.2 % of assets , from a negative $ 33 million as of sept. 30 , thus bringing unk close to regulatory standards .
unk said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ 180 million . critics , however , say the branch sale will make unk more dependent than ever on unk deposits and junk bonds .
mr. paul unk that he intends to further unk the size of unk by not renewing more than $ 1 billion of unk certificates of deposit when they come due . the thrift is also working to unk its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds , and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate , as required under the new thrift law .
on a recent saturday night , in the midst of west germany 's most popular prime-time show , a unk bet the host that she could name any of 100 different unk after just one unk , while unk .
the woman won the bet . but perhaps even more remarkable , the unk , `` unk unk '' ( make a bet ) , regularly wins the top unk in the country 's tv ratings , sometimes drawing as many as 50 % of west german households .
as the 1992 economic integration approaches , europe 's cultural unk have taken to the unk against american `` cultural unk , '' threatening to impose quotas against such pop unk as `` dallas , '' `` miami vice '' and `` l.a. law . '' but much of what the europeans want to protect seems every bit as unk as what they are trying to keep out .
the most unk opposition to american tv imports has come from french television and movie producers , who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60 % of europe 's tv shows be produced in europe . so far , the french have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail .
a unk through the television listings and a few unk of the european television unk suggest one reason why . while there are some popular action and drama series , few unk the high culture and unk production values one might expect . more european air time is filled with unk game shows , variety hours , movies and talk shows , many of which are authorized unk of their american counterparts .
one of france 's most popular saturday night programs features unk seeking out their unk unk for unk unk . a unk game show has as its host a belgian unk to be italian . one of italy 's favorite shows , `` unk , '' a unk variety show , is so popular that viewers unk to buy a unk product , `` unk unk , '' whose unk were sung each week by unk unk -- even though the product did n't exist .
unk the unk unk , on another typical evening of fun on `` unk unk , '' a unk won a bet with the show 's host , thomas unk , that he could identify 300 german unk over the telephone . a unk guest , u.s. ambassador to west germany richard burt , also won a bet that someone could unk up $ 150 worth of quarters on a unk coin . mr. burt nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost , agreeing to spend a day with west german foreign minister unk unk unk and selling their combined weight in unk unk .
if this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the unk barriers , it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get . european programs usually target only their own local audience , and often only a small portion of that . unk in germany or italy rarely make it even to france or great britain , and almost never show up on u.s. screens .
attempts to produce `` unk '' programs have generally resulted in disappointment . one annual unk , the unk `` unk song contest , '' featuring unk songs from each of 20 european countries , has been described as the world 's most boring tv show . another , `` unk unk unk , '' where unk from unk european countries make unk of themselves performing unk tasks , is a hit in france . a unk unk under the title `` almost anything goes '' unk fast .
for the most part , what 's made here stays here , and for good reason . the unk of the british crop , the literary unk that are shown on u.s. public television as `` unk theater , '' make up a relatively small part of british air time . most british programming is more of an acquired taste . there is , for instance , `` one man and his dog , '' a unk contest among sheep dogs . also unk to the british are hours of unk unk , even more hours of lawn bowling unk and still more hours of unk unk .
european drama has had better , though still mixed , fortunes . the most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns . a french unk of `` dallas , '' called `` unk '' and set in a french unk , had a good run in france , which ended after the female lead was injured in a unk auto accident . `` unk , '' ( black forest clinic ) , a kind of german `` unk . elsewhere '' set in a health unk , is popular in germany , and has spread into france .
italy 's most popular series is a drama called `` la unk , '' or `` the unk , '' which unk the fight of an unk young investigator in unk against the mafia . it was unk news in italy earlier this year when the unk inspector was unk down in the series . spain 's most popular unk this year was `` unk , '' the story of an aging unk .
`` the trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular , with american programs second , '' says brian unk , a former director of programs for the british broadcasting corp . `` given a choice , everybody will watch a unk show . ''
but frequently there is n't much choice . thus , europe has begun the recent unk to produce more worthy shows of its own , programs with broader appeal . `` we 've basically got to start from unk , to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see , '' concedes unk young , head of britain 's national film theatre school .
while some in the u.s. contend that advertising is the unk of television , here many believe that its absence is to blame for the european tv industry 's sluggish development . until recently , national governments in europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising . since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into unk , as most american programs are . but not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged unk talk and game shows , while discouraging unk unk .
now , however , commercial channels are coming to most european countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly . just last week , greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; spain earlier began to allow commercial television unk its state channels . the result is a new and huge appetite for programming .
but perhaps to the unk of those calling for quotas , most of this unk is likely to be filled with the unk and most unk programming now available -- reruns -- usually of shows made in the u.s .
sky channel , a unk venture of unk press unk rupert murdoch , offers what must be a unk cultural mix to most of its audience . the financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available unk from its boss 's other ventures . in a madrid hotel room recently , a unk caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on australia 's great barrier unk , only to be urged by the british announcer to `` stay unk for the further unk of unk the unk . ''

british aerospace plc and france 's thomson-csf s.a. said they are unk an agreement to merge their unk divisions , greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors .
the 50-50 joint venture , which may be dubbed unk , would have combined annual sales of at least # 1.4 billion ( $ unk billion ) and would be among the world 's largest missile makers . after two years of talks , plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek french and british government clearance . the companies hope for a final agreement by year-end .
the venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies , and help make them a leading force in european defense contracting . in recent months , a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have unk the unk world of european arms manufacture .
already , british aerospace and french unk thomson-csf unk on a british missile contract and on an unk control radar system . just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy unk international signal plc , a smaller british defense contractor unk by alleged accounting fraud at a u.s. unit .
the sudden unk of british aerospace and thomson-csf -- traditionally bitter competitors for middle east and third world weapons contracts -- is unk controversy in western europe 's defense industry . most threatened by closer british unk ties would be their respective national rivals , including unk s.a. in france and britain 's general electric co. plc . but neither unk nor unk -- unrelated to stamford , unk general electric co. -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces .
yesterday , a source close to unk confirmed that his company may join the unk fight , as part of a possible consortium that would bid against british aerospace and thomson-csf . companies with which unk has had talks about a possible joint unk bid include unk , britain 's unk group plc , west germany 's daimler-benz ag , and france 's dassault group .
but it may be weeks before unk and its potential partners decide whether to bid , the source indicated . unk plans first to study unk 's financial accounts , which auditors recently said included # unk million in unk contracts at a u.s. unit , international signal & control group , with which unk merged last year . also , any unk bid might be blocked by british antitrust regulators ; unk is unk 's main competitor on several key unk contracts , and its purchase by unk may unk british defense ministry worries about unk in the country 's defense industry . a consortium bid , however , would diminish unk 's direct role in unk and might consequently unk ministry officials .
a british aerospace spokeswoman appeared unk by the prospect of a fight with unk for unk : `` competition is the name of the game , '' she said .
at least one potential unk partner , unk , insists it is n't interested in unk . `` we have nothing to say about this affair , which does n't concern us , '' a unk official said sunday .
the missile venture , the british aerospace spokeswoman said , is a needed response to the `` new environment '' in defense contracting . for both thomson and british aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly unk defense ministries ; and middle east sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices .
the venture 's importance for thomson is great . thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other europeans . the european defense industry is consolidating ; for instance , west germany 's unk ag recently joined unk in a takeover of britain 's unk co. , and daimler-benz agreed to buy unk unk unk . unk .
in missiles , thomson is already unk by british aerospace and by its home rival , france 's unk s.a. ; to better compete , thomson officials say , they need a partnership . to justify 50-50 ownership of the planned venture , thomson would make a cash payment to british aerospace .
annual revenue of british aerospace 's missile business is about # unk million , a thomson spokesman said . british aerospace 's chief missile products include its unk family of unk unk missiles . thomson missile products , with about half british aerospace 's annual revenue , include the unk unk missile family .
unk pipe line co. said it will delay a proposed unk , unk million unk ( us$ unk million ) expansion of its system because canada 's output of crude oil is shrinking .
unk , canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major unk of crude to the u.s. , said revised industry forecasts indicate that canadian oil output will total about unk million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate . canadian crude production averaged about unk million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level .
`` the capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said ronald unk , vice president for government and industry relations with unk 's parent , unk energy inc . mr. unk said volume on unk 's system is down about 2 % since january and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s .
`` there has been a swing of the unk back to the gas side , '' he said .
many of canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets unk . the number of active drilling unk in canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' said robert unk , manager of crude oil with calgary 's independent petroleum association of canada , an industry group .
mr. unk said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western canada . unk unk about 75 % of all crude produced in western canada , and almost 60 % of unk 's total volume consists of light crude .
nearly all of the crude oil that canada exports to the u.s. is unk on unk 's system , whose main line runs from unk to major u.s. and canadian cities in the great unk region , including chicago , unk , toronto and montreal .
canada 's current oil exports to the u.s. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about unk % of net u.s. crude imports , said john unk , president of the new york-based petroleum industry research foundation . that ranks canada as the unk source of imported crude , behind saudi arabia , unk and mexico .
mr. unk said canada 's declining crude output , combined with the unk output of u.s. crude , will help intensify u.s. reliance on oil from overseas , particularly the middle east . `` it 's very much a growing concern . but when something is inevitable , you learn to live with it , '' he said .
mr. unk stressed that the delay of unk 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase u.s. unk on offshore crude , however , since canadian imports are limited in any case by canada 's falling output .
under terms of its proposed unk expansion , which would have required regulatory approval , unk intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a modest expansion by 1991 . the system currently has a capacity of 1.55 million barrels a day .
inland steel industries inc. expects to report that third-quarter earnings dropped more than 50 % from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs .
in the second quarter , the steelmaker had net income of $ unk million or $ 1.25 a share , including a pretax charge of $ 17 million related to the settlement of a suit , on sales of $ 1.11 billion .
the company said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by 200,000 tons in the latest quarter , compared with the second quarter .
at the same time , the unk business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses , as well as higher labor costs under its new contract . the unk business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its joseph t. unk & son unit .
the company said it is beginning to see some unk improvements in both the unk and unk segments , which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter .
inland said its third-quarter results will be announced later this week . in the year-earlier third quarter , when the industry was in the midst of a boom , the company had net of $ 61 million , or $ unk a share , on sales of $ 1.02 billion .
predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately .
take microsoft corp. , the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether . in july , the company stunned wall street with the unk that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only 10 % in 1990 , a modest increase when compared with the unk expansion of years past .
investors -- taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the unk -- reacted by selling the company 's stock , which lost $ 3.25 that day to close at $ 52 in national over-the-counter trading .
but that was all of three months ago .
last week , microsoft said it expects revenue for its first quarter ended sept. 30 to increase 34 % . the announcement caused the company 's stock to surge $ unk to close at $ unk a share .
microsoft 's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for unk about the financial health of the computer firms . `` it 's hard to know what to expect at this point , '' said peter rogers , an analyst at robertson unk & co . `` the industry unk unk . ''
to illustrate , mr. rogers said that of the 14 unk firms he follows , half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year 's results , and half above those results .
among those companies expected to have a down quarter are hewlett-packard co. , unk corp. and sun microsystems inc. , generally solid performers in the past . international business machines corp. also is expected to report disappointing results . apple computer inc. , meanwhile , is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended unk .
another unk message comes from businessland inc. , a computer retailer . in july , the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from apple and ibm had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended june 30 to $ 7.4 million , or 23 cents a share .
this month , however , businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended sept. 30 had n't met expectations . the company said it expects earnings of 14 to 17 cents a share , down from 25 cents a share in the year-earlier period .
while the earnings picture unk , observers say the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are unk .
companies will continue to war over standards . in computer publishing , a battle over unk is hurting adobe systems inc. , which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays . until recently , adobe had a lock on the market for image software , but last month apple , adobe 's biggest customer , and microsoft unk . now the two firms are unk on an alternative to adobe 's approach , and analysts say they are likely to carry ibm , the biggest seller of personal computers , along with them .
the short-term outlook for adobe 's business , however , appears strong . the company is beginning to ship a new software program that 's being unk as a unk for owners of unk printers sold by apple . the program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material . john unk , adobe 's chief executive officer , said the mountain view , calif. , company has been receiving 1,000 calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago .
meanwhile , competition between various operating systems , which control the basic functions of a computer , unk trouble for software firms generally . `` it creates uncertainty and usually unk down sales , '' said unk unk , an analyst at unk financial group .
mr. unk said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of unk corp. , maker of a widely used computer publishing program . he expects unk to report earnings of 21 cents a share on revenues of $ unk million for its third quarter , compared with earnings of 30 cents a share on revenue of unk million in the year-earlier period . unk officials could n't be reached for comment .
on the other hand , the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly unk . a bus is the data highway within a computer . ibm is backing one type of bus called unk , while the nine other leading computer makers , including unk and compaq computer corp. , have chosen another method .
`` users do n't care about the bus , '' said daniel unk , an analyst at goldman , sachs & co . he said apple 's family of unk computers , for instance , uses four different buses `` and no one seems to mind . ''
the gap between winners and unk will grow . in personal computers , apple , compaq and ibm are expected to unk their hold on their business . at the same time , unk firms will continue to lose ground .
some lagging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether . unk technology , for instance , is considered a candidate to sell its troubled operation . `` unk has done well establishing a distribution business , but they have n't delivered products that sell , '' said unk brown , an analyst at prudential-bache securities . mr. brown estimates unk , whose terminals business is strong , will report a loss of 12 cents a share for its quarter ended unk .
personal-computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms . unk powerful unk computers , designed with one or more unk as their `` brains , '' are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes .
`` the guys that make traditional hardware are really being unk by unk machines , '' said mr. unk .
as a result of this trend , longtime unk unk , ibm and digital equipment corp. are scrambling to unk with unk systems of their own . but they will have to act quickly . mr. unk expects compaq to unveil a family of high-end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of unk machines .
a unk of new computer companies also has targeted this `` unk '' market .
population drain ends
for unk states
iowa is making a comeback . so are indiana , ohio and michigan . the population of all four states is on the unk , according to new census bureau estimates , following declines throughout the early 1980s .
the gains , to be sure , are rather small . iowa , for instance , saw its population grow by 11,000 people , or 0.4 % , between 1987 and 1988 , the census bureau says . still , even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since 1981 .
between 1987 and 1988 , north unk was the only state in the midwest to lose population , a loss of 4,000 people . six of the 12 unk states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- illinois , kansas , minnesota , missouri , south unk and wisconsin .
the northeast has been holding its own in the population race . seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980 , including new york , which lost 4 % of its population during the 1970s . and although pennsylvania and massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade , they are growing again .
at the same time , several states in the south and west have had their own population turnaround . seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- west virginia , mississippi , louisiana , oklahoma , unk , wyoming and alaska .
overall , though , the south and west still unk the northeast and midwest , and fast-growing states like florida and california ensure that the pattern will continue . but the growth gap between the sun belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing .
more elderly maintain
their independence
thanks to modern medicine , more couples are growing old together . and even after losing a spouse , more of the elderly are staying independent . a new census bureau study of the unk population shows that 64 % of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in 1988 , up from 59 % in 1970 .
this does n't mean they 're less likely to live alone , however . that share has remained at about 24 % since 1970 . what has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other unk , such as children . in 1988 , 10 % of those aged 65 to 74 lived with unk other than spouses , down from 15 % in 1970 .
as people get even older , many become unk . but even among those aged 75 and older , the share living with a spouse rose slightly , to 40 % in 1988 from 38 % in 1970 .
like their younger counterparts , the older elderly are less likely to live with other unk . only 17 % of those aged 75 and older lived with unk other than spouses in 1988 , down from 26 % in 1970 .
the likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40 % from 32 % . more people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off unk and financially .
careers count most
for the unk
many affluent people place personal success and money above family .
at least that 's what a survey by ernst & young and unk , unk , unk indicates . two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs , while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families . being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group .
unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the unk . average household income for the sample was $ unk , and average net assets were reported as $ unk .
the goal was to learn about one of today 's fastest-growing income groups , the unk class . although they represent only 2 % of the population , they control nearly one-third of discretionary income .
across the board , these consumers value quality , buy what they like rather than just what they need , and appreciate products that are unk .
despite their considerable unk and assets , 40 % of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure , and unk do n't feel that they have made it . unk percent do n't even feel they are financially well off .
many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves , either . about 40 % do n't feel they 're more able than others . while unk feel some unk about being affluent , only 25 % give $ 2,500 or more to charity each year .
unk percent attend unk services regularly ; at the same time , 60 % feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one 's principles .
odds and ends
the number of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation 's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978 . the american bankers association says that women make up 47 % of officials and managers in the top 50 banks , up from 33 % in 1978 . the share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16 % from 12 % ... . unk personal income in the u.s. grew faster than inflation last year , according to the bureau of economic analysis . the amount of income unk up for each man , woman and child was $ unk in 1988 , up 6.6 % from $ unk in 1987 . per capita personal income ranged from $ unk in mississippi to $ unk in connecticut ... . there are 13.1 million students in college this fall , up 2 % from 1988 , the national center for education statistics estimates . about 54 % are women , and 44 % are unk students .

more than 30 years ago , prof. harold hill , the con man in meredith unk 's `` the music man , '' warned the citizens of river city , iowa , against the game . now unk spirits on addison 's town council have barred the town 's unk hotel , the grand unk , from unk three free pool tables in its new unk .
mayor lynn unk and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along addison 's main street . and the mayor , in an unk that bears a unk unk to prof. hill 's , warned that `` alcohol leads to betting , which leads to fights . ''
the council 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been unk unk for years . `` obviously they 're not in touch with what 's going on , '' says tom unk , vice president of the national unk unk association . pool is hot in new york and chicago , he insists , where `` upscale , unk places '' are adding tables . with today 's tougher drunk driving laws , he adds , `` people do n't want to just sit around and drink . ''
besides , unk behavior seems unlikely at the grand unk , where rooms average $ 200 a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for $ unk a pop . at the unk , manager elizabeth unk wo n't admit unk in jeans , unk or unk shoes .
but a majority of the addison council did n't buy those arguments . introducing pool , argued unk unk unk , would be `` dangerous . it would open a can of unk . ''
addison is no unk to cans of unk , either . after its previous mayor committed unk last year , an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects , gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town 's unk for trips and unk .
the unk embarrassed town officials , although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the media suggested . now comes the pool unk .

the only thing robert goldberg could unk about cbs 's new show `` island son '' ( leisure & arts , sept. 25 ) was the local color ; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their unk . for instance : `` unk '' ( white ) is not the ultimate unk ; `` unk unk '' is . richard unk unk as a `` unk unk , '' unk in a unk unk and rolling up its long unk . and the local expression for brother is `` unk , '' not `` unk . '' and even if a unk would wear flowers in her hair while on duty , if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left , not right , unk . sorry , the show does not even have the one unk quality of genuine local color .

of all the ethnic unk in america , which is the most troublesome right now ? a good bet would be the tension between blacks and unk in new york city . or so it must seem to unk mason , the veteran jewish unk appearing in a new abc unk airing on tuesday nights ( unk p.m. edt ) . not only is mr. mason the star of `` chicken soup , '' he 's also the unk of a unk tradition dating back to `` duck soup , '' and he 's currently a man in hot water .
here , in unk language , is the unk of mr. mason 's remarks , quoted first in the village voice while he was a paid spokesman for the rudolph giuliani mayoral campaign , and then in newsweek after he and the campaign unk company . mr. mason said that many jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates unk . he said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates unk . he said that unk have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice unk .
of course , mr. mason did not use unk language . as a unk of ethnic humor from the old days on the unk belt , live television and the unk circuit , mr. mason unk reached for the unk . he said unk were `` sick with unk '' ; and he called david dinkins , mr. giuliani 's black opponent , `` a fancy unk with a unk . ''
if mr. mason had used less unk language to unk his unk analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow new unk , would the water be quite so hot ? it probably would , because few or none of the people upset by mr. mason 's remarks have bothered to unk between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used unk language . in addition , some of mr. mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of unk .
for example , the new york state counsel for the unk said that mr. mason is `` like a unk . people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . ''
these critics fail to unk between the type of ethnic humor that aims at unk another group , such as `` polish jokes '' ; and the type that is unk , aiming unk as well as unk . the latter typically is the humor of the unk , and it was unk by both blacks and unk on the unk and unk stage as a means of unk their white and unk audiences along with themselves .
in the hands of a unk like unk bruce , this unk unk could cut both the unk and the audience to unk . but unk by a pro like unk mason , it is a unk form of unk . why unk ? because despite all the media unk about comedy and politics not unk , they are similar in one respect : both can serve as unk for easing unk and unk the unk of groups in conflict . that 's why it 's dangerous to have unk thought police , on college unk and elsewhere , unk all critical mention of group differences .
as elizabeth unk wrote in the new york times just before the mason unk , `` perhaps unk would not unk over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to unk . '' the question is , if group conflicts still exist ( as unk they do ) , and if mr. mason 's type of ethnic humor is unk , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ?
do n't say the tv unk , because that happens to be a unk that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and unk nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy . it is true that the best unk do allow group differences to unk : unk vs. unk unk in `` unk '' ; children vs. adults in `` the cosby show . '' but these are not the differences that make unk .
in `` chicken soup , '' mr. mason plays unk , a jewish unk unk unk ( lynn unk ) , an unk widow and mother of three , against the wishes of his mother ( unk unk ) and her brother michael ( unk unk ) . it 's worth noting that both unk unk are unk . at least , they both speak with strong unk , as do unk and unk . it could n't be more obvious that `` chicken soup '' is being made from an old unk . and a safe one -- imagine if the unk in question were between an orthodox unk and a member of the nation of unk .
back in the 1920s , the play and movie versions of `` unk 's unk rose '' made the theme of unk between the unk unk of jewish and unk unk so popular that its author , anne unk , lost a unk suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public unk . and it has remained there , as unk by its unk in a 1972 cbs unk called `` unk unk unk , '' whose sole unk was that it led to the unk marriage of meredith unk and david unk .
clearly , the question with `` chicken soup '' is not whether the pot will unk over , but whether it will unk at all . so far , the unk have been few and far between . part of the problem is the tendency of all unk , ever since the unk days of norman unk , to unk about social issues . to some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to unk us about ethnic unk by unk them .
for instance , michael unk unk not because he 's a unk jewish businessman , but because he unk his unk job as a salesman in order to become a social worker . even more unk is the unk between unk unk and mr. mason 's comic unk . the best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end ( and occasionally in the middle ) , when mr. mason unk into his unk mode and starts unk out that old-fashioned jewish unk to other people as well as to himself . but too often , these unk lack spark because this unk , like all unk , is unk about unk mr. mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences .
i 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the unk dispute over the unk unk at unk . that issue , like racial unk in new york city , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can unk . but i am suggesting that they stop requiring mr. mason to unk his classic unk with some line about `` unk for other people '' that would sound unk on the unk of miss america . at your age , unk , you ought to know that you ca n't make soup without turning up the unk .
the official white house reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a unk history of calm , right up through friday .

the senate 's decision to approve a unk deficit-reduction bill without a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of unk a gains tax reduction this year .
late friday night , the senate voted unk to approve an estimated $ 13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit . lawmakers drastically unk the bill to unk criticism that it was unk with unk tax breaks and spending increases .
`` we 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill , '' said senate budget committee chairman james unk ( d. , unk . ) .
but senate supporters of the unk legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital-gains tax cut . in addition , the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the house includes a capital-gains provision . house-senate negotiations are likely to begin at unk and last for a while .
`` no one can predict exactly what will happen on the house side , '' said senate minority leader robert dole ( r. , unk . ) . but , he added , `` i believe republicans and democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year . ''
white house budget director richard darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill . `` we do n't need this as a way to get capital gains , '' he said .
house budget committee chairman unk unk ( d. , calif . ) said in an interview , `` if that 's the signal that comes from the white house , that will help a great deal . ''
the senate 's decision was a setback for president bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year . opponents of the cut are playing unk . senate majority leader george mitchell ( d. , maine ) said he was `` confident '' that any house-senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut . and a senior aide to the house ways and means committee , where tax legislation unk , said there are n't any `` plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year . ''
one obvious place to attach a capital-gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill , is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit . such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month .
the senate bill was unk back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through congress . because the legislation has n't been completed , president bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the gramm-rudman deficit-reduction law .
senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the house to agree to the unk bill . the house appears reluctant to join the senators . a key is whether house republicans are willing to unk to their senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions .
`` although i am encouraged by the senate action , '' said chairman dan unk ( d. , ill . ) of the house ways and means committee , `` it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the unk conference with the senate . ''
another big question unk over the debate is what president bush thinks . he has been unk a unk bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut . but republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and unk the 60 votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the unk bill .
the senate bill was stripped of many popular , though unk , provisions , a number of which are included in the house-passed bill . these include a child-care initiative and unk of unk tax breaks for low-income housing and unk expenditures . also missing from the senate bill is the house 's repeal of a law , called section 89 , that unk companies to give unk workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives .
one high-profile provision that was originally in the senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by chairman lloyd unk ( d. , texas ) of the senate finance committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts . mr. unk said he hopes the senate will consider that measure soon .
to the unk of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by the finance committee that would have unk the entire unk system under medicare . to the unk of many low-income people , efforts to boost medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were unk .
asked why senators were giving up so much , new mexico sen. unk unk , the ranking republican on the senate budget committee , said , `` we 're looking like unk . things had just gone too far . ''
sen. dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator . it worked , others said , because there were no exceptions : all unk provisions were unk .
the senate also dropped a plan by its finance committee that would have increased the income unk beyond which senior citizens have their social security benefits reduced . in addition , the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3 % unk tax on long-distance telephone calls . it no longer includes a plan that would have unk what remains of the unk method of accounting , which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden . it also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current unk .
also unk was a unk increase in the maximum unk safety and health administration penalties , which would have raised $ 65 million in fiscal 1990 . a provision that would have made the social security administration an independent agency was unk .
the approval of the senate bill was especially sweet for sen. mitchell , who had proposed the streamlining . mr. mitchell 's relations with budget director darman , who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure , have been unk since mr. darman chose to unk the maine democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill .
the deficit reduction bill contains $ 5.3 billion in tax increases in fiscal 1990 , and $ 26 billion over five years . the unk provisions , which affect mostly corporations , would :
-- prevent companies that have made leveraged buy-outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy-outs , effective aug. 2 , 1989 .
-- require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received , effective the day after the tax bill is enacted .
-- close a unk regarding employee stock ownership plans , effective june 6 , 1989 , that has been unk by investment bankers in corporate takeovers . the measure unk a 50 % exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an unk , if the unk owns less than 30 % of the employer 's stock .
-- curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities , such as zero-coupon bonds , that postpone cash interest payments .
-- raise $ unk million by unk for one year an automatic reduction in airport and unk taxes .
-- speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies , effective august 1990 .
-- impose a tax on unk chemicals , such as those used in air unk and in unk , beginning at $ 1.10 a pound starting next year .
-- unk income taxes from the unk of certain farm workers currently exempt from unk .
-- change the collection of gasoline unk taxes to weekly from unk , effective next year .
-- restrict the ability of real estate owners to escape taxes by unk one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash .
-- increase to $ 6 a person from $ 3 the international unk departure tax , and impose a $ unk tax on international departures by commercial ships .
the measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees . among its provisions :
-- reduction of medicare spending in fiscal 1990 by some $ 2.8 billion , in part by curbing increases in unk to physicians . the plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees next year .
-- removal of the u.s. postal service 's operating budget from the federal budget , reducing the deficit by $ unk billion . a similar provision is in the house version .
-- authority for the federal aviation administration to raise $ unk million by charging fees for commercial unk rights at new york 's unk and john f. kennedy international airports , unk international airport in chicago and national airport in washington .
-- increases in nuclear regulatory commission fees totaling $ 54 million .
-- direction to the u.s. coast guard to collect $ 50 million from users of coast guard services .
-- raising an additional $ 43 million by increasing existing federal communications commission fees and penalties and establishing new fees for unk radio operators , ship stations and mobile radio facilities .

i am in the communications field , above entry level . i was laid off in august 1988 , and after a unk and unk job search , was hired in august 1989 . my unemployment insurance ran out before i found a job ; i found cutbacks and layoffs in many companies .
the statistics quoted by the `` new '' census bureau report ( unk from 1984 to 1986 ) are out of date , certainly as an average for the northeast , and possibly for the rest of the country .

''
just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks , wall street suffered another severe attack of nerves .
does this signal another black monday is coming ? or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity , just like oct. 19 , 1987 , eventually turned out to be ?
here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about friday 's action , what happens next and what investors should do .
joseph unk . `` i 'm the only one who said there would be an october massacre , all through late august and september , '' says mr. unk , once a widely followed market unk and still a well-known newsletter writer .
`` everyone will tell you that this time is different from 1987 , '' he says . `` well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same . if you 're a unk , you unk the signals . right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out . i see no major support until unk . i see a possibility of going to unk this month . ''
mr. unk says he would n't even think of buying until at least 600 to 700 stocks have hit 52-week lows ; about 100 stocks hit new lows friday . `` most people , '' he says , `` have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like . ''
unk unk . a unk analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc. , ms. unk had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the 1987 crash .
friday 's big drop , she says , `` was not a crash . this was an october massacre '' like those that occurred in 1978 and 1979 . now , as in those two years , her stock market indicators are positive . so she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained .
`` those unk lasted one to four weeks and took the market unk % down , '' she says . `` this is exactly the same thing , as far as i 'm concerned . '' thus , she says , if the dow jones industrial average dropped below unk , `` it would just be a unk . my advice is to buy . ''
as she unk it , the average stock now sells for about 12.5 times companies ' earnings . she says that ratio could climb to 14.5 , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of `` fair value . ''
unk davis . friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market , says mr. davis , president of unk davis research inc . but mr. davis , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says he expects no unk crash .
`` there was a unique combination in 1987 , '' he says . `` margin debt was at a record high . there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds . the main thing was portfolio insurance , '' a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses . `` a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject '' to it . in 1987 , such selling contributed to a unk effect .
today could even be an up day , mr. davis says , if major brokerage firms agree to unk from program trading . over the next several months , though , he says things look bad .
`` i think the market will be heading down into november , '' he says . `` we will probably have a year-end rally , and then go down again . sort of a unk bear market . '' he expects the downturn to carry the dow jones industrial average down to around 2000 sometime next year . `` that would be a normal bear market , '' he says . `` i guess that 's my forecast . ''
unk g. unk . `` i do n't think the market is going through another october unk . i do n't think that 's the case at all , '' says mr. unk , a partner at goldman , sachs & co. and chairman of goldman sachs asset management .
mr. unk sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does n't think there 's any need to rush . `` i expect the market to open weaker monday , but then it should find some stability . ''
he unk off several major differences between now and two years ago . unlike 1987 , interest rates have been falling this year . unlike 1987 , the dollar has been strong . and unlike 1987 , the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of unk .
but the economy 's slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits `` is n't good , '' he says . `` so it 's a very mixed bag . ''
thus , he concludes , `` this is not a good environment to be fully invested '' in stocks . `` if i had come into friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , i would not do any buying . but we came into friday with a conservative portfolio , so i would look to do some modest buying '' on behalf of clients . `` we 're going to look for some of the unk companies that got unk '' friday .
john kenneth unk . `` this is the latest unk of the capacity of the financial community for unk unk , '' says mr. unk , an economist .
`` i see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , '' he says . `` the explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has unk a lot of unk securities in the hands of investors and unk the corporations that are the unk of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity . this has both made investors unk and the corporations more vulnerable . ''
nevertheless , he says a depression does n't appear likely . `` there is more unk in the economy at large than we commonly unk , '' he says . `` it takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the unk -- much as the financial community and the government may try . ''
mario unk . new york money manager mario unk , an expert at unk takeover candidates , says that takeovers are n't totally gone .
`` companies are still going to buy companies around the world , '' he says . examples are `` ford looking at jaguar , bellsouth looking at lin broadcasting . '' these sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so mr. unk figures they will continue .
`` the market was up 35 % since { president } bush took office , '' mr. unk says , so a correction was to be expected . he thinks another crash is `` unlikely , '' and says he was `` unk at '' selected stocks during friday 's plunge .
`` stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity { this } week for guys like me , '' he says .
jim rogers . `` it seems to me that this is the unk that has finally unk the balloon , '' says mr. rogers , a professor of finance at columbia university and former unk of one of the most successful hedge funds in history , quantum fund .
he sees `` economic problems , financial problems '' ahead for the u.s. , with a fairly strong possibility of a recession . `` friday you could n't sell dollars , '' he says . dealers `` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . '' if the dollar stays weak , he says , that will add to unk pressures in the u.s. and make it hard for the federal reserve board to ease interest rates very much .
mr. rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the london and tokyo markets go . he recommends that investors sell unk stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness .
frank unk . many people now claim to have predicted the 1987 crash . unk newsletter writer francis unk unk actually did it : he stated in writing in september 1987 that the dow jones industrial average was likely to decline about 500 points the following month .
mr. unk says what happens now will depend a good deal on the federal reserve board . if it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks , he says , `` that could quiet things down . '' if not , `` we could go to unk very soon . ''
frank w. unk . stock prices `` would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , '' says mr. unk , president and managing director of renaissance investment management inc. in cincinnati .
renaissance , which manages about $ 1.8 billion , drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally .
renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents , primarily u.s. treasury bills . `` unk probably are the right place to be , '' he says .

regarding the oct. 3 letter to the editor from rep. tom unk , chairman of the house subcommittee on employment and housing , alleging :
1 . that your sept. 28 editorial `` unk committees '' was unk unk and deliberately misleading .
i thought your editorial was unk accurate and deliberately unk .
2 . that mr. unk supported the rights of the witnesses to take the fifth amendment .
yes , he did . as i watched him on unk , i heard him speak those lovely words about the bill of rights , which he quotes from the unk of the hearings . he did repeat those nice unk several times as an indication of his support for the constitution . he used about 56 words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights .
unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better than 5,000 words unk unk on the witnesses for exercising the fifth . he unk his unk of constitutional meat between large unk of unk commentary . as your editorial unk pointed out , samuel pierce , former hud secretary , and unk wilson , mr. pierce 's former aide , `` are currently being held up to unk for taking the fifth amendment . '' that certainly is not the supposed `` distorted reading '' indicated by mr. unk .
3 . that his `` committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at hud . my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court ... unk . ''
unk unk . by any `` reasonable man '' unk , mr. unk and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted . apparently , their verdict is in . right now they 're pursuing evidence . that 's not a bad way to proceed , just somewhat different from standard american practice .
how was that practice referred to when i was in school ? unk , yes , something called a star chamber .
of course , mr. unk unk protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change . no doubt that 's partially true . everything that mr. unk says in his letter is partially true . he 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hud officials . but if his explanation of unk is true , why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity ? why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and unk ? such as , what happened when congress wanted to know about $ 400 toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost ? no , mr. unk 's complaints simply wo n't wash .
4 . that the journal unk `` the unk , fraud , waste , unk , unk and abuse of the public that took place while mr. pierce was secretary of hud , '' etc. and so forth .
no , to my mind , the journal did not `` defend unk , fraud , waste , unk , unk and abuse of the public trust ... '' it defended appropriate constitutional unk and practical common sense .
the problem , which the journal so unk pointed out in a number of articles , is not the likes of mr. unk , who after all is really a bit player on the stage , but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a unk body . ( of course , we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective . ) the system is the problem , not an individual member . individuals can always have their hands unk . it 's when such unk does n't occur that we 've got trouble .
i do not by any means defend hud management . but i think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to american unk of liberty and freedom than any unk ( and , yes , maybe unk ) within hud could possibly generate . the last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when `` unk unk joe '' unk did his work .
raymond unk
unk , n.j .
i disagree with the statement by mr. unk that one should not draw an adverse unk against former hud officials who unk their fifth amendment privilege against unk in congressional hearings .
the fifth amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be unk , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself . '' this privilege against unk unk the drawing of an adverse unk against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify . thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be unk to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to `` take the fifth . '' the privilege , however , has been limited in unk with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only .
the supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the fifth amendment does not preclude the unk where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . '' unk v. unk , unk u.s. unk ( 1976 ) . thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the fifth , and his taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse unk against him in the civil matter . he may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and unk belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution . allowing the defendant to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony unk him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unk used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . unk the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify .
thus , when mr. pierce asserted the fifth in a unk proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a unk , unk belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . the subcommittee , congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse unk and to unk with mr. pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help unk him of a crime . drawing the adverse unk in a unk congressional hearing does not unk the fifth amendment shield against unk .

it was friday the 13th , and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 points . just a unk ? or is unk -- fear of the number 13 -- justified ?
in unk , a so-called friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different unk .
robert unk and unk unk , unk of finance at the university of miami , found evidence that the market is spooked by friday the 13th . but their study , which unk the unk period , has since been shown to be unk by an unk choice of data .
in the unk , the market took falls nine times in a row on friday the unk . but the date tends to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to yale unk , a unk of stock market unk .
another study found that the 82 unk the 13th in the unk period had higher than average returns -- higher even than unk in general , which tend to be strong days for stock prices .
on the only other friday the 13th this year , the dow jones industrial average rose about four points .
professor unk says the original study , titled friday the 13th , part unk , was published unk . in a similar unk , he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and saturday 's full moon could have played a part , too , in friday 's market activity .
unk of those during the 1987 crash -- that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity unk , some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went unk .
`` we could n't get dealers to answer their phones , '' said robert king , senior vice president of otc trading at unk co. in atlanta . `` it was { like } the friday before black monday '' two years ago .
whether unk phone calls had any effect or not , nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the new york and american exchanges . nonetheless , the nasdaq composite index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever , unk unk , or 3 % , to unk . ten points of the drop occurred during the last 45 minutes of trading . by comparison , the new york stock exchange composite tumbled 5.8 % friday and the american stock exchange composite fell 4 % .
on oct. 16 , 1987 , the nasdaq composite fell unk points , or 3.8 % , followed by its devastating unk , or 11 % slide , three days later .
nasdaq volume friday totaled unk million shares , which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year . the unk record of unk million shares was set on oct. 21 ,
`` there was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved , '' said unk `` unk '' unk , president of unk , unk , unk , a new york company that makes markets in thousands of otc issues .
most of the complaints about unk phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors . mr. king of unk and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls , rather than a unk attempt to avoid making trades .
the subject is a unk one for nasdaq and its unk companies , which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash .
peter unk , head of retail equity trading at shearson lehman hutton , declared : `` it was the last hour of trading on a friday . there were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots . it was n't unk , we were all busy . ''
james unk , head of otc trading at hambrecht & quist in san francisco , said , `` it was just like two years ago . everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time . ''
unk mullins , the otc trading chief at dean witter reynolds in new york , said unk that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading . but , he added , `` you can only take one call at a time . ''
market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain unk trading when imbalances occur . on days like friday , that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to . when selling is so unk , prices fall unk and fast . two years ago , faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories , market makers themselves began unk shares , unk the slide in otc stock prices .
on friday , some market makers were selling again , traders said . but , with profits sagging on wall street since the crash , companies have kept smaller share unk on hand .
mr. unk of hambrecht & quist said some prices fell without trades taking place , as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares . `` everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid , '' he said .
so , while otc companies incurred losses on friday , trading officials said the damage was n't as bad as it was in 1987 . `` two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big unk . i do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now , '' said mr. king of unk .
tony unk , head of equity trading at unk , unk & unk in minneapolis , said that unk unk actually made money on friday . it helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago , he said .
joseph unk , president of the national association of securities dealers , which oversees the nasdaq computerized trading system , said that despite the rush of selling , he never considered the situation an `` emergency . ''
`` the pace of trading was unk , '' he said . nasdaq 's small order execution system `` worked unk , '' as did the automated system for larger trades , according to mr. unk .
nevertheless , the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices unk will shake many investors ' confidence . in the past , the otc market unk on a firm base of unk participation . because nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to unk levels , traders and otc market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent .
but they are worried . `` we were just starting to get the public 's confidence back , '' unk mr. mullins of dean witter .
more troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could unk erode the base of unk support the otc market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the october 1987 crash .
mr. unk of unk unk says some action from government policy makers would unk investor fears . it wo n't take much more to `` scare the hell out of retail investors , '' he says .
the sellers on friday came from all corners of the otc market -- big and small institutional investors , as well as individual investors and market makers . but unk traders said the sell orders generally ranged from 20,000 shares to 50,000 shares , compared with blocks of 500,000 shares or more two years ago .
shearson 's mr. unk said retail investors unk sold stock friday and never returned to unk . institutional investors , which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in unk gains made through the third quarter , were unk .
`` we had a good amount of selling from institutions , but not as much panic , '' mr. unk said . `` if they could n't sell , some of them put the shares back on the shelf . '' in addition , he said , some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some otc stocks whose prices were beaten down .
in addition , mr. unk said computer-guided program selling of otc stocks in the russell index of 2000 small stocks and the standard & poor 's 500-stock index sent unk `` waves `` through the market .
nasdaq 's biggest stocks were unk . the nasdaq 100 index of the largest unk issues , including the big otc technology issues , tumbled 4.2 % , or unk , to unk . the nasdaq financial index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped 2 % , or unk , to unk .
the otc market has only a handful of unk stocks . but they fell sharply . mccaw cellular communications , for instance , has offered to buy lin broadcasting as well as metromedia 's new york city cellular telephone interests , and in a separate transaction , sell certain mccaw properties to contel cellular . mccaw lost 8 % , or 3 1\/2 , to 40 . lin broadcasting , dropped 5 1\/2 , or 5 % , to 107 1\/2 . the turnover in both issues was roughly normal .
on a day when negative unk news did n't sit well with investors , commercial unk , a maker of engineered metal parts , said haas & partners advised it that it does n't plan to pursue its previously reported $ unk bid to buy the company . commercial unk plummeted 6 to 26 .
the issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled friday . on the otc market , first executive , a big buyer of the high-risk , high-yield issues , slid 2 to 12 1\/4 .
among other otc issues , intel , dropped 2 1\/8 to 33 7\/8 ; unk transportation lost 1 1\/8 to 19 1\/2 ; the american depositary receipts of jaguar were off 1\/4 to 10 1\/4 ; mci communications slipped 2 1\/4 to 43 1\/2 ; apple computer fell 3 to 45 3\/4 and unk dropped 2 1\/4 to 66 3\/4 .

pension funds , insurers and other unk of the investing world said they began unk up stocks during friday 's market unk . and they plan to buy more today .
unk or unk , many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the october 1987 crash : buying at the bottom pays off .
to be sure , big investors might put away their unk in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today . they could still panic and bail out of the market . but their 1987 performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse .
`` last time , we got unk for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst , '' said john w. rogers , president of chicago-based unk capital management inc. , which manages $ 1.1 billion of stocks .
mr. rogers spent half his cash on hand friday for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart . '' he expects to invest the rest if the market unk further .
unk portfolio manager james craig was n't unk when friday 's unk unk $ 40 million from the value of the $ unk million unk fund he oversees . `` i waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through , '' he said . then he jumped into the market : `` i spent $ 30 million in the last half-hour . ''
other money managers also opened their unk . `` i was buying at the close ( friday ) and i 'll be buying again because i know we 're getting good value , '' said frederick a. unk , president of unk asset management inc. , greenwich , conn . `` there is no unk on the fundamental level for this crash . ''
unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell unk when investors rush to withdraw money , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market unk without unk stock . most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be the unk long-term investment , attracting about $ 1 trillion from pension funds alone .
`` if you bought after the crash , you did very very well off the bottom , '' said stephen b. unk , chief investment officer of chicago-based kemper financial services inc . the $ 56 billion california public employees retirement system , for one , added $ 1 billion to its stock portfolio two years ago .
`` the last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders , and that they ca n't react to short-term events , good or bad , '' said stephen l. unk , senior vice president for the pension consultants unk associates in santa unk , calif . `` those that pulled out ( of stocks ) unk it , '' he said , `` so i doubt you 'll see any significant changes '' in institutional portfolios as a result of friday 's decline .
stocks , as measured by the standard & poor 's 500-stock index , have been unk performers this year , rising unk % before friday 's plunge , excluding dividends . even friday 's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20 % , well above the annual average for stocks over several decades .
`` you could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market , '' said james d. unk , president of new york-based unk capital corp .
mr. unk , however , worries that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days . it can happen before you can turn around . '' he said he unk many parallels with 1987 , including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the unk of computerized program trading . `` the only thing you do n't have , '' he said , `` is the ` portfolio insurance ' phenomenon unk on the rest . ''
most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique , which is widely thought to have unk the 1987 crash . not really insurance , this unk was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of s&p futures contracts . in its unk test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't work , as stock buyers unk and stock and futures prices became unk .
even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim friday , money managers said . neil unk , whose new york-based unk capital partners had converted 85 % of its $ unk million investment pool to cash in recent months , said he was unk by wall street firms friday asking him to take stock off their hands .
`` we got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything , '' said mr. unk , who , happy with his returns on investments unk up earlier , declined the offers .
mr. unk predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again , unk more investors . `` i think it will be a unk unk rally , '' he said . meanwhile , friday brought a unk for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally . especially unk were the short sellers , who have been unk by this year 's market climb .
the unk sell borrowed shares , hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price . the nation 's largest unk operation is unk brothers , palo alto , calif. , which said last may that its short positions had shown losses of 10 % for the year up to that point .
all that now has changed . `` we 're ahead for the year because of friday , '' said the firm 's kurt unk . `` we 're not making a killing , but we had a good day . ''
food and drug administration spokesman jeff unk said the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning unk pharmaceuticals inc. to the u.s. attorney 's office in baltimore .
neither unk nor any of the unk gardens , n.y. , company 's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes . unk won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it unk a smithkline unk plc product as its own in tests .
mr. unk also said the fda has asked bolar pharmaceutical co. to recall at the retail level its unk unk unk . but so far the company has n't unk with that request , the spokesman said .
bolar , the subject of a criminal investigation by the fda and the inspector general 's office of the health and human services department , only agreed to recall two unk of its version of unk `` as far down as direct customers , mostly unk , '' mr. unk said .
bolar , of unk , n.y. , earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 unk and 50 unk versions of the drug .
the fda has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that bolar unk the brand-name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of unk . bolar has denied that it switched the brand-name product for its own in such testing .
the west german retailer unk deutsche unk ag plans to challenge the unk of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the netherlands .
the eventual court decision could become a landmark in dutch corporate law because the lawsuit unk plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to unk trusts to unk voting power of common stockholders .
up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged , though unsuccessfully , unk 's dutch lawyers noted .
should the courts unk the unk of this type of defense , unk will then ask the court to unk such a unk maneuver recently deployed by unk unk unk . unk says the unk international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus unk the worth and voting power of unk and other shareholders .
speaking through its dutch lawyers , unk also disclosed it holds a 15 % stake in unk . it was previously thought unk held a 13.6 % stake that was unk since july .
a spokesman for unk said his company is confident of its own position and the unk of the unk issue . he termed unk 's legal actions as `` unk '' to international cooperation among european retailers .
chase manhattan bank chairman unk unk is a conservative banker and a loyal republican , but on friday morning he had few kind words for president bush 's economic unk .
`` there are some very significant issues out there , such as the fiscal deficit , the trade deficit , our relations with japan , that have to be the subject of major initiatives , '' he said in an interview . `` i 'd like to see that initiative , and i have n't . there is n't a big shot , an agenda . ''
a few hours later , the stock market dropped 190 points .
politicians tried to finger each other for the blame , although many analysts doubt that washington was unk responsible for wall street 's woes . but mr. unk 's comments make one thing clear : some on wall street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy .
consider this :
-- by unk p.m. tonight , president bush must order $ 16 billion of automatic , across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the gramm-rudman budget law . the cuts are necessary because congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a unk bill . `` we simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , '' house budget committee chairman unk unk ( d. , calif . ) said yesterday on nbc news 's `` meet the press . ''
-- for the last two weeks , the bush administration and the federal reserve have been engaged in a unk battle over international economic policy . the administration has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the fed has been unk . `` one of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary unk between the treasury department and the federal reserve board , '' said lawrence unk , a bear , stearns & co. economist , on abc 's `` this week . ''
-- the administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers .
last month , transportation secretary sam skinner forced northwest airlines to reduce a stake held by unk royal dutch airlines . but he has since run into opposition from the treasury and the white house over that decision . and he has kept unk on how his decision might affect a bid for united airlines , which includes a big stake by british airways plc . some analysts say uncertainty about washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the united airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop .
in many ways , the unk to friday 's stock decline is unk similar to that of october 1987 's unk crash . then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold . the treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with west german officials rather than the federal reserve . and concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the unk house ways and means committee rather than the transportation department -- were making markets nervous .
the 1987 crash brought the reagan administration and democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period .
but , barring further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year . lawmakers and administration officials agree that friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's unk plan , which still is n't fully implemented .
one of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one-day unk tumble . `` everybody thought we were looking at a unk of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , '' rep. unk said yesterday in an interview . `` that did not happen . they learned they could survive it without much problem . ''
but administration officials privately agree with mr. unk , who said a unk drop this week `` is going to force the president and congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . ''
in that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around . `` there is an underlying concern on the part of the american people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said senate finance committee chairman lloyd unk ( d. , texas ) .
nevertheless , it clearly will take more than friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and white house budget director richard darman over the capital-gains fight . hill democrats are particularly angry over mr. bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of april 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation .
`` there is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , '' senate majority leader george mitchell ( d. , maine ) said yesterday on cbs news 's `` face the nation . ''
during last week 's unk on the unk bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that senate republicans and the administration were at odds . at the very moment that senate republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it .
when an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , oregon sen. bob packwood , the ranking gop member of the unk senate finance committee , hailed it . asked if the administration agreed , he unk replied : `` the unk will have to speak for itself . ''
friday 's market tumble could spur action on unk the house and senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the unk .
senate republicans expressed the hope that the house would follow the lead of the senate , which on friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit .
`` the market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the house of representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , sen. warren unk ( r. , unk . ) . said yesterday .
the white house office of management and budget , whose calculations determine whether the gramm-rudman targets are met , estimated that the house-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 unk by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the congressional budget office 's estimate of $ unk billion . rep. unk said that unk 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` we 're getting very close to the margins here . ''
no one in washington was willing to take the blame for unk friday 's drop in the stock market . but some players were quick to seize the moment . before the sun had set on friday , richard unk , the supply-side chief economist of the u.s. chamber of commerce , issued a statement unk the drop in stock prices to the senate decision to postpone action on capital gains . `` investors , who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell , were spooked , '' he said .
`` there have been many unk reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut , '' sen. mitchell said during his television appearance , `` but i suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others . ''

small investors matched their big institutional unk in anxiety over the weekend , but most seemed to be taking a unk approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market .
`` i 'm not losing faith in the market , '' said boston lawyer christopher sullivan as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm . but he 's not so sure about everyone else .
`` i think on monday the small ( investors ) are going to panic and sell , '' predicted mr. sullivan , whose investments include amr corp. 's american airlines unit and several mutual funds . `` and i think institutions are going to come in and buy ... i 'm going to hold on . if i sell now , i 'll take a big loss . ''
some unk an optimism that had been unk when they did n't unk the market in 1987 . `` oh , i bet it 'll be up 50 points on monday , '' said unk unk , a unk retired unk in lexington , unk . mrs. unk said her unk investment club 's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the black monday crash , `` but no one got unk , and we gained that back -- and more . ''
at the annual congress of the national association of investors corp. at the unk unk hotel in minneapolis , the scene was calm . some 500 investors representing investor clubs from around the u.s. were attending when the market started to slide friday . but robert unk , an official of the association , said no special unk or emergency meetings of the investors ' clubs are planned .
in fact , some of the association 's members -- long-term , unk investors -- welcomed the drop in prices . `` we hope to take advantage of it , '' said john unk , a member of a los angeles investors ' club . he has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants . not everyone is reacting so unk , however , and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of friday 's slide , reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of ual corp. , parent of united airlines .
unk unk , a unk , fla. , investment banker , said the market drop is one of `` a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged unk era is ending . there 's no question that there 's a general unk for leverage among lenders . '' mr. unk believes , however , that the market could be stabilized if california investor marvin davis steps back in to the united bidding with an offer of $ 275 a share .
unk albert , a unk dallas law student , says she 's generally unk about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it . `` i have this feeling that it 's built on sand , '' she says , that the market rises `` but there 's no foundation to it . '' she and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987 crash , although she still owns some texaco stock . partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school , `` i think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid . ''
others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand . `` we all assumed october unk was a one-time shot , '' said san francisco attorney david greenberg . `` we told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime , come on back . now it 's happening again . '' mr. greenberg got out just before the 1987 crash and , to his regret , never went back even as the market soared . this time he 's ready to buy in `` when the panic wears off . '' still , he adds : `` we ca n't have this kind of thing happen very often . when the little guy gets frightened , the big guys hurt badly . merrill lynch ca n't survive without the little guy . ''
small investors have unk back into the market following black monday , but mostly through mutual funds . discount brokerage customers `` have been in the market somewhat but not whole unk like they were two years ago , '' says unk quick jr. , chairman of the quick & unk discount brokerage firm . hugo unk , senior vice president at charles unk corp. , says unk customers `` have been unk to cautious recently about stocks . '' individual investors are still angry about program trading , mr. unk says .
unk unk , a cornell university finance professor , says government regulators will have to more closely control program trading to `` win back the confidence of the small investor . ''
but it 's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried . alan unk , general sales manager of a chrysler dealership in houston , said he and his mother have some joint stock investments , but the overall economy is his chief worry .
`` these high unk took a big unk today , '' he said in his unk , which is within a few miles of the unk dollar homes of some of houston 's unk citizens . `` and i can tell you that a high unk is n't going to come in tomorrow and buy a chrysler unk by unk . '' and , finally , there were the unk . `` i got out in 1987 . everything , '' said unk unk , an unk , ohio , unk contractor who was visiting chicago and stopped by fidelity investments ' unk street office . `` i just stopped by to see how much i would have lost . ''
would mr. unk ever get back in ? `` are you unk ! when it comes to money : once unk , 2,000 times shy . ''
the crowded field for unk computers is about to become a lot more crowded .
compaq computer corp. 's long-awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market , especially zenith electronics corp. , the current market leader , and on a unk of promising unk .
compaq 's series of unk unk a trend toward unk in the personal computer market . one manufacturer already has produced a unk computer called a unk , and two others have introduced even smaller `` unk . ''
but those machines are still considered unk , with unk only a unk could love and screens to match . compaq 's unk , by contrast , may be the first in their weight class not to unk on features found in much bigger machines . analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they 're priced aggressively at $ unk to $ 5,000 . all of this comes in a machine that unk only six pounds and fits unk into most unk .
in recent months , compaq 's competition , including zenith , toshiba corp. , tandy corp. and nec corp. all have introduced unk that weigh approximately the same and that are called unk -- perhaps unk . one analyst , noting that most such machines are about two inches thick , takes exception to the name . `` this is n't quite a notebook -- i call it a unk , '' he says .
that ca n't be said of the $ unk unk computer introduced a few weeks ago by grid systems corp. , a unit of tandy . instead of a unk , it features a writing surface , an electronic unk and the ability to `` read '' block printing . at 4 1\/2 pounds , it may be too unk named , but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts unk .
unk are n't far behind . unk corp. 's portfolio , introduced in europe two months ago and in the u.s. in early september , unk less than a pound , costs a mere $ 400 and runs on three unk unk , yet has the power to run some unk and word processing programs . some critics , however , say its ability to run unk programs is restricted by a limited memory .
unk computer corp. , meanwhile , has introduced a much more sophisticated unk that can run lotus unk and other sophisticated software programs , but costs five times as much .
at stake is what mike unk , compaq 's president of north america operations , calls `` the unk unk of the computer industry '' -- the search for `` a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere . '' the market is so new , nobody knows yet how big it can be . `` i 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is , '' says tom unk , director of marketing for grid . `` whether it 's $ 5 billion or $ 3.5 billion , it does n't matter . it 's huge . ''
consider the growth of unk , which now unk 12 % of all personal computer sales . unk -- generally anything under 15 pounds -- have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment , with sales doubling this year .
responding to that demand , however , has led to a variety of compromises . making computers smaller often means unk memory . it also has unk use of the faster , more powerful unk found in increasing numbers of desktop machines . size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays .
the competitive unk can get pretty unk at times . a unk spokesman , for example , unk the unk portfolio because it requires three unk while the unk needs only two . both unk are dismissed by notebook makers , who argue that they 're too small -- a problem unk also encountered in focus groups , admits unk unk , director of marketing . unk , trying to avoid the `` unk '' label , responded with the unk line , `` the unk pc -- a very big computer . ''
despite the unk , few question the unk of the move to small machines that do n't make compromises . toward that end , experts say the real battle will take place between unk players like toshiba , zenith and now compaq .
compaq 's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like unk inc. , which introduced in june a computer that , like compaq 's , uses an intel unk microprocessor and has a hard disk drive . but the unk product is twice as heavy and costs more than compaq 's .
compaq 's announcement also unk trouble for zenith , which last year had 28 % of the u.s. laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to cie. des machines bull , the french government-owned computer maker . zenith holders will vote in december on the proposed $ unk million sale , a price that could slip because it is pegged to zenith 's share and sales .
compaq is already taking aim at zenith 's market share . rod unk , compaq 's president and chief executive officer , notes unk that zenith 's $ 2,000 unk uses an `` unk '' unk unk disk , unk compaq 's new machines use the more common 3 unk disk . john p. frank , president of zenith data systems , simply unk off such criticism , noting that 3 unk unk were also `` unk '' when they first replaced unk disks . `` we do n't look at it as not being a standard , we look at it as a new standard , '' he argues .
analysts do n't see it that way . `` i ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is unk for compaq and a unk for everyone else , '' says gene unk , president of professional marketing management inc . adds bill unk , senior industry analyst for unk , a high-technology market research firm : `` we basically think that these are very hot products . the problem compaq is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them . ''
compaq 's machines include the 3 unk unk disk drive , a unk screen that is only unk thick and an internal expansion unk for a unk -- in other words , almost all the unk of a typical office machine .
others unk will follow , but most analysts believe compaq has at least a six-month lead on the competition . toshiba 's line of unk , for example , features the unk , which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory , and the unk , which also uses a unk microprocessor , but which unk almost twice as much and is three times the size . a third model , marketed in japan , may hit the u.s. by the end of the first quarter of 1990 , but by then , analysts say , compaq will have established itself as one of three major players .
what about big blue ? international business machines corp. , analysts say , has been burned twice in trying to enter the laptop market and shows no signs of trying to get into unk anytime soon .
honeywell inc. and international business machines corp. received air force contracts to develop integrated circuits for use in space .
honeywell 's contract totaled $ unk million , and ibm 's $ unk million .
boeing co. received a $ unk million air force contract for developing cable systems for the unk missile .
general dynamics corp. received a $ 29 million air force contract for unk training sets .
grumman corp. received an $ unk million navy contract to upgrade aircraft electronics .
unk corp. received an $ 11.8 million army contract for helicopter engines .
sharp increases in the price of fresh produce caused spain 's september consumer price index to shoot up 1.1 % from the previous month , pushing the annual rate of inflation to 6.8 % , the national institute of statistics said friday .
the monthly increase is the highest recorded in the past four years .
the index , which registered unk at the end of september , has a base of 100 set in 1983 and is n't seasonally adjusted .
prices have risen 5.9 % in the first nine months of the year , unk both the initial 3 % inflation goal set by the government of socialist prime minister unk gonzalez and the second , revised goal of 5.8 % .
japan 's wholesale prices in september rose 3.3 % from a year earlier and were up 0.4 % from the previous month , the bank of japan announced friday .
the wholesale price index stood at unk , compared with a 1985 base of 100 .
plunge ? what plunge ?
unk new york stock exchange issues hit 52-week highs during friday 's trading , despite the dow jones industrial average 's 190.58-point plunge .
stocks of utilities held up relatively better than other market sectors during the sell-off . and among the issues hitting new highs were detroit edison co. and unk unk power corp . other major issues hitting highs included american telephone & telegraph co. , westinghouse electric corp. , exxon corp. and cigna corp. , the big insurer .
of course , many more issues -- 93 -- hit new lows . these included international business machines corp. , which during friday 's session traded below $ 100 a share for the first time since june 1984 . ibm closed at $ 102 , down $ unk . other new lows included unk international corp. , union carbide corp. and bethlehem steel corp. , all of which are included in the industrial average .
meanwhile , two initial public offerings unk the unk market in their unk day of national over-the-counter trading friday . shares of rally 's inc. , an operator of fast-food restaurants , closed at $ 17 each , up from its $ 15 offering price and shares of employee benefit plans inc. , a health-care consultant , closed at $ unk , up from its $ 12 offering price .
ford motor co. said it acquired 5 % of the shares in jaguar plc . jaguar , the london stock exchange and the u.s. securities and exchange commission are being notified of the transactions , the company said .
the u.s. federal trade commission advised ford last week that it would n't raise any unk to the acquisition of as much as 15 % of jaguar shares .
the no. 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as 15 % of the british luxury-car maker , the maximum allowed under current united kingdom government restrictions . general motors corp. said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with jaguar before ford began buying shares . gm said it still is talking with jaguar about acquiring a minority interest .
investors who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is , `` on margin '' -- may be more worried than most following friday 's market drop .
that 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans . in october 1987 , these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward unk of the stock market .
typically , a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75 % of its original value . if the investor does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call , the brokerage firm may begin liquidating the securities .
but some big brokerage firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls . margin calls since friday `` have been higher than usual , but reasonable , '' a spokesman for shearson lehman hutton inc. said .
merrill lynch & co. officials `` do n't expect { margin calls } to be as big a factor as in 1987 '' because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin , a spokesman said .
hugo unk , senior vice president at charles unk corp. , the san unk discount brokerage firm , said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for unk customers . he said unk had increased margin requirements `` so customers have more of a cushion . '' he added : `` we learned a lesson in 1987 about volatility . ''
unk inc. , following rival unk corp. 's lead , said it is backing out of unk programs with three airlines .
the garden city , n.y. , unk company said it wo n't renew contracts with nwa inc. 's northwest airlines unit , pan am corp. 's pan american world airways unit and unk airlines at the end of this year . but it remains involved in programs with amr corp. 's american airlines unit and delta air lines .
industry estimates put unk 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ 8 million and $ 14 million . a spokesman for unk would n't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for `` far less than half '' of the total .
budget rent a car corp. , of chicago , and national car rental systems inc. , of minneapolis , both said they had no plans to follow suit . in fact , budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which unk earn unk miles and unk can get unk discounts .
`` i can not see how this news by unk and unk can not benefit budget 's programs , '' said bob wilson , budget 's vice president , marketing planning . northwest and unk are two of the five airlines with which budget has agreements .
national also unk in the northwest unk program along with four other airlines , including delta and usair group inc. 's usair unit .
a month ago , unk , of park unk , n.j. , said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with delta , america west and texas air corp. 's continental airlines and eastern airlines , and that unk with american airlines , ual inc 's united airlines and usair also would be ended ... sometime after dec. 31 . at the time , unk said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ 20 million and that the value of redeemed unk topped $ 15 million . analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers were that high . budget said its unk costs are `` substantially below '' unk 's level .
robert d. unk , unk vice president of marketing , said , `` the proliferation and costs attached to { unk programs } have significantly diminished their value . ''
this year has been difficult for both unk and unk , said charles unk , unk industry analyst at alex . brown & sons . `` they 've been looking to get their costs down , and this is a fairly unk way to do it , '' he said .
cbs inc. is cutting `` the pat unk show '' down to one hour from its current 90 minutes .
cbs insisted the move was n't a setback for the program , which is the network 's first entry into the unk talk show unk since 1972 .
`` i have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it , '' said rod unk , who was named vice president of late night entertainment in august . `` this will raise the energy level of the show . ''
cbs will continue to program unk shows to follow the unk hour . but cbs news will extend its unk `` unk '' by 30 minutes and begin at unk a.m .
the show , despite a promising start , has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as compiled by a.c. nielsen co. , finishing far below `` tonight '' on nbc , a unit of general electric co. , and `` unk '' on unk , a unit of capital cities\/abc inc . further unk the unk audience is the addition of the `` unk hall show , '' unk by paramount communications inc .
tandem computers inc. , preparing to fight with international business machines corp. for a piece of the mainframe business , said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended sept. 30 .
tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $ 450 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share . the results , which are in line with analysts ' estimates , reflect `` a continued improvement in our u.s. business , '' said james unk , tandem 's chief executive officer .
in the year-earlier period , tandem reported net income of $ unk million , or 31 cents a share , on revenue of $ unk million .
tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week . analysts have predicted that the cupertino , calif. , company will report revenue of $ unk million to $ unk million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share .
commenting on the results for the quarter , mr. unk said the strength of the company 's domestic business came as `` a surprise '' to him , noting that sales `` in every region of the u.s. exceeded our plan . ''
the company 's u.s. performance was helped by `` a record quarter for new customers , '' he said .
tandem makes `` unk '' computers -- machines with unk backup systems -- that run stock exchanges , networks of automatic unk and other complex computer systems . tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever , which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers .
tandem 's new high-end computer is called unk . prices for the machine , which can come in various unk , are $ 2 million to $ 10 million .
analysts expect the new computer to unk a hefty unk of business away from ibm , the longtime leader in mainframes .
`` we believe they could unk perhaps two to three billion dollars from ibm '' over the next few years , said george weiss , an analyst at the unk group . that will spur tandem 's growth . `` i 'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than 20 % next year , '' said john unk , an analyst at goldman , sachs & co .
ibm is expected to respond to tandem 's unk by discounting its own mainframes , which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from tandem . `` obviously ibm can give bigger discounts to users immediately , '' said mr. weiss .
but mr. unk questions whether that will be enough to stop tandem 's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from big blue 's machines . `` the answer is n't price reductions , but new systems , '' he said .
nevertheless , tandem faces a variety of challenges , the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as unk to ibm 's mainframes . even mr. unk is reluctant to abandon this notion , insisting that tandem 's new machines are n't unk for ibm 's mainframes .
`` we 're after a little bigger niche , '' he said .
do n't jump yet . the stock market 's unk may turn out to be good news for the economy .
in one wild hour of trading , the market managed to accomplish what the bush administration has been trying to do , unsuccessfully , for weeks . it is forcing the federal reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously unk dollar . the resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could unk american business -- indeed , the entire economy .
this may sound unk optimistic . after all , until a few years ago , the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy . when it went down , by all tradition , the economy followed .
that has changed , partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable . the 1987 crash was `` a false alarm however you view it , '' says university of chicago economist victor unk .
the market seems increasingly unk from the rest of the nation . its unk ca n't be unk to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to unk major shifts in the economy . `` the market today has a life of its own , '' john unk , chairman of international business machines corp. , said saturday . `` there 's nothing rational about this kind of action . ''
of course , the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week . sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the u.s. now relies for financial unk . the financial-services industry was battered by the 1987 crash . what 's more , although the stock market is far less unk today than two years ago , the u.s. economy is weaker . growth is slower . profits are softer . debt burdens are heavier .
but if the stock market does n't continue to unk , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate . the fed , which until friday had been unk moves to ease credit , is now poised to unk money into the economy if needed to unk the markets . fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies . but the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets .
anticipating the fed 's move , money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the federal funds rate to unk % late friday , down from unk % the day before . tiny movements in the rate , which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans , are usually among the few visible tracks that the fed leaves on the monetary markets .
the dollar also began to decline friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to unk their desire to invest in the u.s . treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of unk with economic fundamentals , threatening to unk the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years . the market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the treasury was right about the unk dollar .
a modest drop in the dollar -- only a modest one , mind you -- would be welcomed by the u.s . that was n't the case in 1987 , when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse , producing panic among foreign investors and unk the flow of foreign capital to the u.s .
another big difference between 1987 and 1989 is n't so unk . in the third quarter of 1987 , the economy unk at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3 % . the consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3 % in the third quarter of 1989 , which ended two weeks ago .
the plunge in stock prices `` is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down , '' says economist lawrence unk of unk group , a unk unk , pa. , forecasting company . `` a lot of unk demand is gone . ''
consumer spending did drop in the months following black monday 1987 -- `` but only slightly and for a short period of time , '' recalls mr. unk , a longtime student of business cycles . `` that was offset by strength elsewhere . { the effects } were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected . '' today , he unk , exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices unk this week and if consumers unk in reaction .
what 's more , the corporate borrowing unk has n't unk in the past two years . `` we 've had two more years of significant accumulation of debt ... just at the time when earnings are being squeezed , '' mr. unk notes . the more a company relies on borrowed money , the greater its unk to an economic slowdown . a company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm ; a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court .
the fed , of course , knows that very well -- hence its unk to pump credit into the economy this morning . but , in the process , the fed risks unk inflation . even before friday 's events , harvard university economist benjamin friedman was arguing that the fed wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets , banks and highly leveraged corporations . the biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession , he reasons ; it 's an unk of unk inflation .
in the end , the 1987 collapse suggested , the economy does n't move in unk with stock prices . the economy does , however , depend on the confidence of businesses , consumers and foreign investors . a panic on wall street does n't exactly inspire confidence .
surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before friday . a 190-point drop is n't likely to make much of a unk ; unk that a few times over , though , and it will . if the reactions of executives gathered saturday at hot springs , va. , for the business council meetings are typical , business leaders were n't overly unk by friday 's decline . and if foreign investors become a unk more cautious -- well , the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the u.s. can stand it .
on the bottom line , the most unk fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before . two years ago , about the only point of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent depression . the unk had a unk audience . the prosperity that followed black monday permits a more optimistic view today .
at the very least , the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation 's success in handling the last unk . as sen. lloyd unk ( d. , texas ) observed yesterday , `` the fed avoided a unk last time . they are more sophisticated this time . ''
the chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in the third quarter because of unk prices in the commodity end of the business .
producers of commodity chemicals , the basic chemicals produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers , have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers . once the chief beneficiaries of the industry 's now unk boom , these producers also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the 1988 third quarter .
`` for some of these companies , this will be the first quarter with unk negative comparisons , '' says leonard unk , a chemical industry analyst at prudential unk research . `` this could be the first of five or six down quarters . ''
perhaps most prominent , dow chemical co. , which as of unk had unk up eight consecutive record quarters , is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier , if only by a unk . though dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals , the company still has a big stake in polyethylene , which is used in packaging and unk .
analysts ' third-quarter estimates for the midland , mich. , company are between $ unk a share and $ unk a share , compared with $ unk a year ago , when profit was $ unk million on sales of $ unk billion . a dow spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates .
at the investment firm of smith barney , harris upham & co. , the unk segment is seen pulling down overall profit for 20 companies representative of the whole industry by 8 % to 10 % . `` you will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better , '' says james wilbur , a smith barney analyst .
first boston corp. projects that 10 of the 15 companies it follows will report lower profit . most of the 10 have big unk operations .
still , some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains , largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals . du pont co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white unk , fibers and unk . moreover , the wilmington , del. , company is helped when prices weaken on the commodity chemicals it buys for its own production needs , such as unk .
analysts are divided over whether du pont will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its unk inc. oil company . the estimates for du pont range from $ 2.25 to $ unk a share . in the 1988 third quarter , the company earned $ unk million , or $ unk a share , on sales of $ unk billion . du pont declined to comment .
monsanto co. , too , is expected to continue reporting higher profit , even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern europe and the western u.s . the st. unk company is expected to report again that losses in its unk searle & co. pharmaceutical business are narrowing . searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year , but monsanto has said it expects searle to post a profit for all of 1989 .
most estimates for monsanto run between $ unk and $ 2 a share . a year ago , the company posted third-quarter profit of $ unk million , or $ unk a share , on sales of $ unk billion . monsanto declined to comment .
but the unk producers are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle . by some accounts on wall street and in the industry , the inventory reductions are near an end , which may unk firmer demand . but unk say growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early 1990s .
in the latest quarter , at least , profit is expected to fall sharply . for unk inc. , `` how far down it is , we do n't know , '' says unk unk at salomon brothers . the projections are in the neighborhood of 50 cents a share to 75 cents , compared with a restated $ 1.65 a share a year earlier , when profit was $ unk million on sales of $ unk million .
unk faces lower prices for its mainstay product , unk , while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for unk , whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries . the company , based in wilmington , del. , is unk by montedison s.p . a. , milan , which has an offer outstanding for the unk shares it does n't already own .
at quantum chemical corp. , new york , the trouble is lower prices for polyethylene , higher debt costs and the unk of an important plant due to an explosion . some analysts hedge their estimates for quantum , because it is n't known when the company will book certain one-time charges . but the estimates range from unk to 35 cents a share . in the 1988 third quarter , quantum earned $ unk million , or $ unk a share , on sales of $ unk million .
another big polyethylene producer , union carbide corp. , is expected to post profit of between $ 1 a share and $ 1.25 , compared with $ unk a share a year earlier , when the company earned $ unk million on sales of $ unk billion .
unk , quantum and union carbide all declined to comment .

there were no major unk or foreign bond offerings in europe friday .
the economy 's unk will be taken from several unk points this week , with unk on trade , output , housing and inflation .
the most troublesome report may be the august merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow . the trade gap is expected to widen to about $ 9 billion from july 's $ 7.6 billion , according to a survey by unk international , a unit of mcgraw-hill inc. , new york .
thursday 's report on the september consumer price index is expected to rise , although not as sharply as the 0.9 % gain reported friday in the producer price index . that gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in friday 's session , before it got started on its reckless 190-point plunge .
economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in september reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow . meanwhile , september housing starts , due wednesday , are thought to have inched upward .
`` there 's a possibility of a surprise '' in the trade report , said michael unk , director of research at unk . a widening of the deficit , if it were combined with a unk strong dollar , would unk trade problems -- but the dollar weakened friday as stocks plummeted .
in any event , mr. unk and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made . `` trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow , '' he said .
exports are thought to have risen strongly in august , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists said .
views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read september 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more unk total employment figures in their calculations . the wide range of estimates for the industrial output number unk the differences : the forecasts run from a drop of 0.5 % to an increase of 0.4 % , according to unk .
a rebound in energy prices , which helped push up the producer price index , is expected to do the same in the consumer price report . the consensus view expects a 0.4 % increase in the september unk after a flat reading in august .
robert h. unk , an economist for lloyd 's bank in new york , is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the unk than in prices at the producer level . `` auto prices had a big effect in the unk , and at the unk level they wo n't , '' he said .
food prices are expected to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped as much as 4 % , said gary unk , economist at unk financial group . he also says he thinks `` core inflation , '' which unk the volatile food and energy prices , was strong last month . he expects a gain of as much as 0.5 % in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases .
housing starts are expected to unk a bit from august 's annual pace of unk units . economists say an august rebound in permits for unk units signaled an increase in september starts , though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards .

assuming the stock market does n't crash again and completely unk unk and trading rooms , american television audiences in a few months may be seeing britain 's concept of both . `` capital city '' is a weekly series that unk here three weeks ago amid unprecedented unk by its producer , unk television .
the early episodes make you long for a unk of the crash of 1987 . let 's make that 1929 , just to be sure .
according to the program 's publicity prospectus , `` capital city , '' set at unk unk , a unk unk securities firm with # 500 million capital , `` follows the fortunes of a unk team of young , unk dealers , hired for their particular unk of style , unk and energy . but with all the money and unk of high finance come the unk pressures to do well ; pressure to pull off another million before lunch ; pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second ... ''
you need n't be a unk securities lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure . the unk produced series has been criticized by london 's financial unk as unk in detail , but its major weakness is its unk unk of the characters ' professional and private lives .
turned loose in unk unk 's trading room , the unk dealers do little right . judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes , unk unk 's capital should be just about exhausted by the final 13th week .
in the opening episode we learn that michelle , a junior bond trader , has indeed pulled off another million before lunch . trouble is , she has lost it just as quickly . rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world , michelle unk about it to a unk man while ordering lunch over the phone .
little chance that unk unk is going to unk today . traders spend the morning unk selling bonds , in the belief that the u.s. monthly trade figures will look unk . unk , unk columbia ! the trade figures turn out well , and all those recently unk bonds unk in price . so much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second . and a large unk of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly unk japanese bonds ( since when is anything japanese nearly unk unk ? ) . surprisingly , unk unk unk the week , only to have a senior executive unk unk his way into becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation . instead of closing ranks to protect the firm 's reputation , the executive 's internal rivals , led by a unk american , demand his resignation . the plot is unk when the firm 's major unk , unk unk on the other side of the globe , unk home to support the executive . but the investigation continues .
if you can unk the unk that the rewards for such unk are unk salaries , you still are left unk , because few of the unk consume very unk . in fact , few consume much of anything . two share a house almost unk of furniture . michelle lives in a hotel room , and although she drives a unk unk , she has n't time to clean or repair it ; the unk vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of unk because the unk key has broken off in the lock . and it takes unk , the unk unk ' man of the cast , until the third episode to get past first base with any of his unk .
perhaps the explanation for these unk is that unk britain is n't ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the unk unk regime . after all , this is n't old money , but new money , and in many cases , young money .
this attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of max , the trading room 's most unk character . unk enough , he lives in a unk unk converted church , wears designer clothes and drives an unk car . but apparently to make him unk , even unk , to the unk , the script unk unk max into an unk unk , master of 11 chinese unk . he takes his wash to the unk , where he meets a unk french girl who unk him into providing a home for her pet unk and then promptly unk his car and unk it in unk .
in producing and promoting `` capital city , '' unk has spent about as much as unk unk loses on a good day . the production costs are a not unk # 8 million ( $ 12.4 million ) , and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of `` dealers , '' an earlier unk movie . another half million unk went for a unk of unk advertisements in six major british newspapers and for huge unk in the london unk .
these expenses create a special incentive for `` capital city 's '' producers to unk it , or a unk version of it , in america . unk 's u.s. marketing agent , donald unk , is preparing to do just that . he is unk hopeful , citing three u.s. comedy series -- `` three 's company , '' `` too close for comfort '' and `` check it out '' -- that had british unk .
perhaps without unk it , mr. unk simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution : `` capital city '' should have been a comedy , a worthy unk to the unk british `` carry on '' movies of the 1960s .
the seeds already are in the script . the first episode concluded with a unk unk scene in which the unk crew unk a baby , the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm . and many in the young cast bear striking unk to american tv and movie unk known for light roles . unk unk looks like a young unk unk unk ; william armstrong , who plays max , could pass for unk unk , and douglas unk ( unk ) for james unk ; unk unk is a unk unk unk and unk unk could easily double for unk hall , the unk unk of the unk boys unk .
so , ok kids , everybody on stage for `` carry on trading '' : the cast is unk searching the office for unk japanese bonds that suddenly have soared in value because dai-ichi kangyo bank has just bought the white house . the pressure is too much for unk unk , who unk a security guard . he unk into a desktop computer terminal , which unk , covering unk hall 's face with unk . and all the while , the bonds are in the baby 's diaper .
it should run forever .

unk assurances of france gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ 4.5 billion acquisition of farmers group inc. , in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine u.s. states where farmers operates .
the proposed acquisition is part of sir james goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for b.a.t industries plc , the british tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that is parent of los angeles-based farmers . in an attempt to unk u.s. regulators ' concern over a goldsmith acquisition of farmers , sir james in august agreed to sell farmers to axa if he is successful in acquiring b.a.t .
as part of the agreement , axa agreed to invest $ 1 billion in unk investments ltd. , sir james 's acquisition vehicle .
of the total $ 5.5 billion to be paid to unk by axa , about $ 1 billion will come from available resources of axa 's parent , unk group , $ 2.25 billion will be in the form of notes issued by axa , and the remaining $ 2.25 billion will be in long-term bank loans .
in an interview thursday , unk bebear , chairman and chief executive officer of axa , said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by cie . financiere de paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing . the other banking companies in the group are credit lyonnais , societe generale , bankamerica corp. and citicorp , he said .
mr. bebear said unk group has `` more than $ 2.5 billion of unk assets that we can and will sell '' to help pay off debt from the acquisition . he said the assets to be sold would be `` unk '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of farmers . `` we wo n't put any burden on farmers , '' he said .
the amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , unk has an unk obligation to sell farmers to axa upon an acquisition of b.a.t . `` we hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate unk , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because unk wo n't be an owner of farmers at anytime , '' mr. bebear said .
any change of control in farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where farmers and its related companies are incorporated .
the amended filings were required because of the new agreement between axa and unk , and to reflect the extension that sir james received last month under british takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition . unk dropped its initial # unk billion ( $ unk billion ) takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the unk sale of farmers to axa receives regulatory approval .
a spokesman for b.a.t said of the amended filings that , `` it would appear that nothing unk has changed . the new financing structure is still a unk leveraged one , and axa still plans to take out 75 % of farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt . '' that dividend is almost double the 35 % currently taken out of farmers by b.a.t , the spokesman added . `` it would have severe implications for farmers ' policy holders . ''
to fend off sir james 's advances , b.a.t has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would unk it to a tobacco and financial services concern .
dismal sales at general motors corp. dragged the u.s. car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early october , the first sales period of the 1990 model year .
the eight major domestic auto makers sold unk north unk cars in the first 10 days of october , a 12.6 % drop from a year earlier . unk built truck sales were down 10.4 % to unk unk , vans and sport utility vehicles .
the heavy use of incentives to clear out 1989 models appears to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of 1990 model sales , which began officially oct. 1 . this appears particularly true at gm , which had strong sales in august and september but saw its early october car and truck results fall unk % from last year 's unusually high level .
overall , sales of all unk vehicles fell unk % from a year ago . without gm , overall sales for the other u.s. unk were roughly flat with 1989 results .
some of the u.s. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models , but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up . `` we 've created a condition where , without incentives , it 's a tough market , '' said tom kelly , sales manager for bill unk chevrolet in dearborn , mich .
car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.8 million vehicles , the lowest since october 1987 . the poor performance unk with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month . furthermore , dealers contacted late last week said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of friday 's steep market decline .
gm 's domestic car sales dropped unk % and its domestic trucks were down an even unk unk % from the same period a year ago . all of the gm divisions except unk showed big declines . unk posted a 3.2 % increase despite new competition from lexus , the unk luxury-car division of toyota motor corp . lexus sales were n't available ; the cars are imported and toyota reports their sales only at unk .
the sales drop for the no. 1 car maker may have been caused in part by the end in september of dealer incentives that gm offered in addition to consumer rebates and unk financing , a company spokesman said . last year , gm had a different program in place that continued unk dealers until all the 1989 models had been sold .
aside from gm , other car makers posted generally mixed results . ford motor co. had a 1.8 % drop in domestic car sales but a 2.4 % increase in domestic truck sales .
chrysler corp. had a 7.5 % drop in car sales , unk its generally slow performance all year . however , sales of trucks , including the company 's popular minivans , rose 4.3 % .
honda motor co. 's sales of unk built vehicles plunged unk % from a year earlier . honda 's plant in unk , ohio , was unk up to build 1990 model accords , a honda spokesman said . `` we 're really confident everything will bounce back to normal , '' he added .
separately , chrysler said firm prices on its unk domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5 % over unk equipped 1989 models . firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced earlier this fall . at that time , chrysler said base prices , which are n't adjusted for equipment changes , would rise between 4 % and 9 % on most vehicle .
a - totals include only vehicle sales reported in period .
c - domestic car
d - percentage change is greater than unk % .
x - there were 8 selling days in the most recent period and 8 a year earlier . percentage differences based on daily sales rate rather than sales volume .

it was n't so long ago that a radio network funded by the u.s. congress -- and originally by the central intelligence agency -- was accused by officials here of unk unk , unk and unk . now , the network has opened a news bureau in the unk capital .
employees held an open house to unk and even unk out a sign : `` unk unk radio '' -- radio free europe .
`` i think this is a victory for the radio , '' says unk de unk , a unk former unk unk who works in the unk , west germany , headquarters as deputy director of the unk service . in fact , the network hopes to set up offices in warsaw and anywhere else in the east bloc that will have it .
but the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are unk the network 's life in more ways than one . in fact , radio free europe is in danger of suffering from its success .
while the network currently can operate freely in budapest , so can others . in addition , competition for unk is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled . instead of being denounced as an evil agent of unk , radio free europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too unk , even boring .
`` they have a lot to do these days to compete with unk radio , '' says andrew unk , a unk student at the technical university in budapest . `` the unk { radio } reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here . ''
indeed , hungary is in the midst of a media explosion . boys on busy street corners unk newspapers of every political unk . unk are packed with a unk array of magazines . radio and television are getting unk and unk .
the british broadcasting corp. and the u.s. state department 's voice of america broadcast over unk unk , though only a few hours a day each in unk . australian press unk rupert murdoch has bought 50 % stakes in two popular and unk unk newspapers , while britain 's robert maxwell has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar moves .
but radio free europe does n't plan to unk away . with its mission for free speech and the capitalist way , the network 's staff says it still has plenty to do -- in hungary and in the `` great eastern beyond . '' radio free europe and its sister station for the soviet union , radio liberty , say they wo n't cut back their more than 19 hours of daily unk . they are still an important source of news for 60 million unk in 23 exotic unk : from unk and unk to unk and unk .
the establishment of its first bureau in warsaw pact territory shows the unk of some of the changes in eastern europe . months before the decision by the unk communist party to unk itself socialist and try to look more appealing to voters , the country 's unk were trying to look more unk . it proved a perfect time for radio free europe to ask for permission to set up office .
not only did the unk ministry of foreign affairs approve radio free europe 's new location , but the ministry of telecommunications did something even more amazing : `` they found us four phone lines in central budapest , '' says unk unk , a radio free europe unk who helped unk the budapest location . `` that is a unk . ''
it 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network , which had to overcome unk of its unk and unk of local unk ( who filed reports to the network by phone , secret unk or letters ) . in fact , some of the network 's unk unk say they owe radio free europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the `` dark ages of the 20th century . ''
`` during the past four years , many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our unk , '' says the writer . `` there were some very unk unk . ''
the unk , too , had to be unk . through much of the unk war ii period , listening to western unk was a crime in hungary . `` when we listen to the europe station , my mother still gets nervous , '' says a budapest unk . `` she wants to turn down the volume and close the unk . ''
now , the unk competition for radio free europe comes during the unk unk . unk radio often unk its most politically unk unk for around midnight . television , which most of the time is considered rather unk , has entered the running with a new program , `` the end of the day , '' which comes on after 11 p.m . it is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss hungary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs . those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on sunday morning for `` sunday journal , '' on unk radio .
the competitive spirit is clearly unk radio free europe , which is trying to beef up programs . the budapest office plans to hire free-lance reporters to cover the latest unk in unk country towns from unk in the west to unk in the east . the unk service has a daily unk news show called unk , with international and domestic news , plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world .
there 's also a host of new programs , trying to unk up on the traditional diet of politics . a daily unk program called `` the march of time '' tries to find interesting unk of unk news and unk from around the world . there 's a program for women and a science show . and to attract younger unk , radio free europe unk the latest in western rock groups . the pet shop boys are big this year in budapest .
`` we are unk for all the news , '' says mr. unk , the student . `` every moment we want to know everything about the world . ''
proposals for unk `` national service , '' like unk , unk up from time to time , unk the resistance of the body unk , run their course , and seem to disappear , only to unk and unk public life unk .
the disease unk comes to mind , of course , not as an unk on the advocates of national service . rather , it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing unk of a unk idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s , along with unk .
it is back with us again , in the form of legislation to pay unk under a `` national and community service act , '' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall .
why does the unk virus keep coming back ? perhaps it is because unk unk unk both military experience and the social unk . if only we could get america 's unk youth into at least a unk uniform we might be able to teach unk again and revive the spirit of giving .
a quarter of a century ago national service was unk as a way of unk the unk unk of the draft -- by , of all things , expanding the draft . those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many unk backers , despite their protests that present plans contain no unk .
choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to unk national service as much as the draft . but the virus was kept alive in unk departments until a couple of years ago , when it again was let loose . this time it attempted to unk two connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans . why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the advocates unk , but require some form of service from each unk ? military service , moreover , could be a unk option .
thus , unk it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove unk , unk unk conservatives , unk unk , and unk liberals . the democratic leadership council , a unk group unk the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents . a provision allowing grants to be applied to unk purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of unk .
the unk plan unk `` unk '' unk trees , unk unk , unk children , and unk unk for $ 100 a week , tax free , plus medical care . with a tax-free $ 10,000 unk payment at the end of each year , the unk would be making a wage comparable to $ unk a year . mind you , most of `` the unk '' would be unk 17 - to unk , some not even high school graduates , and many saving money by living at home . they would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families .
as it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the unk unk decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` give in order to get . '' opposition to national service from the pentagon , which wants to protect its own unk process , also led to the unk option being dropped .
clearly , a new unk for national service had to be unk up . what better place to turn than sen. edward kennedy 's labor committee , that great unk of government unk , where many a unk pot of unk is kept on the back unk until it can be brought forward and presented as unk unk ?
in this case , the new unk for national service called for throwing many unk legislative unk into one unk : a demonstration project for educational aid ( particularly satisfying to the unk and sen. sam unk ) , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation ( a la sen. chris unk ) , a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects ( a kennedy specialty ) , a community service unk program for students ( unk to the unk of sen. dale unk , among others ) , plus unk of the unk volunteer program and the retired senior volunteer , foster unk , and senior companion programs . before the unk is printed , the house may add more unk , also changing the initial price , now posted at some $ unk million .
it is widely known that `` too many unk unk the unk , '' but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the unk , especially if they are senators . the `` omnibus '' bill coming out of congress may be unk unk , but the unk unk are happy and the restaurant is pushing the unk very hard . the unk of unk is in the air .
is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ? on the contrary , it is as robust as ever . according to the unk poll , american adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service , while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen 30 % ( adjusted for inflation ) .
even if government does see various `` unk needs , '' national service is not the way to meet them . if we want to support students , we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more unk based on something called `` unk , '' rather than on the government 's idea of `` service . '' or we might provide a tax credit for working students . what we do not need to do is start a war , and then try to justify it by creating a unk bill .
to the extent we lack unk to staff unk jobs in hospitals , for example , we should raise pay , pursue unk technology , or allow more legal unk , rather than unk high school graduates as short-term workers and cause unk among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs .
will national service , in the current highly unk and unk form unk enough appeal to get adopted ? not necessarily . polls show wide , unk support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any unk public backing . nonetheless , senate democrats are organizing a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` unk '' and `` unk , '' some of which may hope to receive the paid `` unk . ''
so far , the president seems unk to substitute any of the omnibus for his own unk proposal to unk a `` points of light '' foundation with $ 25 million to inform citizens of all ages and unk them to genuine unk .
however , even this unk plan could become unk if the white house gives in to congressional democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in `` unk '' federal funds for volunteer projects .
there 's no need for such concessions . the omnibus can be defeated , the virus controlled , and real service protected . national service , the unk idea , still wo n't go away then , of course , but the millions of unk youth performing works of `` unk content '' will be unk only in the unk of their unk .

the inflation-adjusted growth rate for france 's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to unk % from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7 % , the national statistics institute said .
the state agency said the latest revision left the growth rate for the first-quarter compared with the previous three months unchanged at 1.3 % .
if the economy continues to expand by unk % a quarter for the rest of the year , it would leave unk growth for all of 1989 at 3 % , the institute said . that would be down from the 3.8 % rise posted in 1988 .

the debate over national service has begun again . after a decade in which more than 50 unk established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a unk to high-school unk , the focus has shifted to washington .
at least 10 bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in congress this spring . one , unk by sen. sam unk ( d. , unk . ) and rep. dave unk ( d. , unk ) , would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served . an omnibus bill assembled by sen. edward kennedy ( d. , mass. ) , and including some diluted unk provisions along with proposals by fellow democratic sens. unk unk , barbara unk and christopher unk , has been reported out of the senate labor committee . it might well win senate passage . president bush has outlined his own youth entering service ( yes ) plan , though its details remain to be specified .
what is one to think of all this ? doctrine and special interests govern some responses . people eager to have youth `` pay their unk to society '' favor service proposals -- unk mandatory ones . so do those who seek a `` unk concept of unk , '' a concept imposing stern obligations as well as unk rights . then there are unk opponents . to unk , mandatory service is an unk and voluntary systems are unk uses of tax money . unk of the market question the value of the work national service would perform : if the market wo n't pay for it , they argue , it ca n't be worth its cost . elements of the left are also unk opposed ; they see service as a cover for the draft , or fear the unk of youth , or want to see rights unk , not obligations .
but what about those of us whose views are not unk by formula or unk ? how should we think about national service ? let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion -- `` national service '' has no agreed meaning . would service be voluntary or unk ? short or long ? unk or full-time ? paid or unpaid ? would participants live at home and work nearby or live in unk and work on public unk ? what kinds of work would they do ?
what does `` national '' mean ? would the program be run by the federal government , by local governments , or by private voluntary organizations ? and who would serve ? only males , as with the draft , or both unk ? youth only or all ages ? middle-class people , or poor people , or a genuine unk ? many or few ?
those are not unk questions , and the label `` national service '' answers none of them . then how should we think about national service ? as a starting point , here are five unk :
1 . consider the unk , not the name . ignore `` national service '' in the unk ; consider specific proposals . they will differ in crucial ways .
2 . `` service '' should be service . as commonly understood , service implies sacrifice . it involves accepting risk , or giving up income , or deferring a career . it follows that proposals like unk , whose benefits to unk are worth some $ unk a year , do not qualify . there is a unk for such bills : federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a unk bill without the unk '' ; unk those benefits should be earned , not given . but the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs . why call that service ?
3 . encouragement is fine ; unk is not . unk service is unconstitutional . it is also unk and unk . ( who will throw several hundred thousand unk in jail each year ? ) but through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior . it should also encourage service -- unk by all classes and all ages . its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of unk in the u.s. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local unk about which tasks most need doing .
4 . good programs are not cheap . enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done unk : forest fires fought , housing unk , students unk , unk centers unk . there is important work to be done , and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even unk who start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not unk .
good service programs require unk , unk , training and supervision -- all of high quality . they involve unk to participants . full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at stanford or yale . unk programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to some $ 10,000 a year . are they worth that ? unk suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted . but the calculations are unk .
5 . unk youth are a special concern . are such expenditures unk , then ? yes , if targeted . people of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for middle-class kids , and their elders , to serve at little public cost . they can volunteer at any of thousands of unk institutions , or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers .
unk youth do n't have those opportunities . they are not unk in high school or college . they are unlikely to be employed . and they have grown up in unk grim circumstances , among family structures breaking down , surrounded by unk unk and bleak prospects . but many of them can be quite unk unk by productive and disciplined service .
some wo n't accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons . but some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed . learning skills , producing something unk , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them . even if it is cheaper to build unk or paint apartments or plant unk with paid professionals , the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation .
strictly speaking , these youth are not performing service . they are giving up no income , deferring no careers , unk no risk . but they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin to respect themselves ( and others ) , to take control of their lives , to think of the future . that is a service to the nation . it is what federal support should try hardest to achieve .

government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a monday market unk -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet .
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan was on the unk , making it clear to officials in the u.s. and abroad that the fed was prepared to unk massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in october 1987 , if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis .
and at the treasury , secretary nicholas brady talked with friends and associates on wall street while assistant secretary david mullins carefully unk data on the friday market plunge .
but the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters . in addition , officials at the fed and in the bush administration decided that avoiding unk actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's unk .
`` the disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said one government official , insisting on unk .
the fed 's efforts at unk were partly unk sunday morning , when both the new york times and the washington post carried stories unk a senior fed official saying the central bank was prepared to unk cash into the banking system monday morning . fed chairman greenspan was surprised by both stories , according to knowledgeable sources , and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment . nevertheless , fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate unk of the central bank 's game plan . it is prepared to assume the same role it played in october 1987 , providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system unk . the fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions .
the unk of federal officials was evident in the appearance sunday of budget director richard darman on abc 's `` this week . '' `` secretary of the treasury brady and chairman greenspan and the chairman of the sec and others have been in close contact . i 'm sure they 'll do what 's right , what 's prudent , what 's unk , '' he said .
when it was suggested his comment was a `` unk , '' mr. darman replied : `` it is a unk . but , in this context , that 's the smart thing to do . ''
at the treasury , secretary brady issued a statement unk the stock market 's drop . `` today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy , '' he said . `` the economy remains unk , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . ''
but administration officials conceded that friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week . `` one possibility is that this is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its unk , and not a major problem , '' said one senior administration official , who also asked that he not be named . `` the other is that we see another major disaster , like two years ago . i think that 's less likely . ''
nevertheless , fed chairman greenspan and vice chairman manuel johnson were in their offices sunday evening , monitoring events as they unk in markets around the world . the action was expected to begin with the opening of the new zealand foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. est -- when stocks there plunged -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in tokyo and through early this morning in europe . both the treasury and the fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments . in tokyo , share prices dropped sharply by 1.7 % in early monday morning trading . after the initial slide , the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower .
in the bush administration , the lead is being taken by treasury secretary brady , undersecretary robert unk and assistant secretary mullins . the three men worked together on the so-called brady commission , headed by mr. brady , which was established after the 1987 crash to examine the market 's collapse . as a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets , and financial market crises .
mr. brady was at the white house friday afternoon when the stock market 's decline began . he was quickly on the phone with mr. mullins , who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the new york and chicago exchanges . later , mr. brady unk mr. greenspan , sec chairman richard breeden and numerous contacts in new york and overseas . aides say he continued to work the phones through the weekend .
administration officials say president bush was unk throughout friday afternoon and evening , even after leaving for camp david . he had frequent telephone unk with mr. brady and michael unk , chairman of the counsel of economic advisers .
government officials tried throughout the weekend to unk a unk appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic . treasury undersecretary david mulford , for instance , was at a meeting of the business council in hot springs , va. , when the stock market fell , and remained there through the following day . and as of last night , fed chairman greenspan had n't canceled his plans to address the american bankers association convention in washington at 10 a.m. this morning .
ironically , mr. greenspan was scheduled to address the same convention in dallas on oct. 20 , 1987 . he flew to dallas on oct. 19 , when the market plummeted unk points , but then turned around the next morning and returned to washington without delivering his speech .

put down that phone .
walk around the room ; take two deep unk . resist the urge to call your broker and sell all your stocks .
that 's the advice of most investment professionals after friday 's 190-point drop in the dow jones industrial average .
no one can say for sure what will happen today . and investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months . but they 're nearly unk on one point : do n't sell into a panic .
investors who sold everything after the crash of 1987 lived to regret it . even after friday 's plunge , the dow jones industrial average was 48 % above where it landed on oct. 19 two years ago .
panic selling also was unk during other big declines in the past . the crash of 1929 was followed by a substantial recovery before the great depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began . the `` october unk '' of 1978 and 1979 were unk , but did n't lead to severe or sustained unk .
indeed , some pros see friday 's plunge , plus any further damage that might occur early this week , as a chance for bargain hunting . `` there has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash , '' says stephen b. unk , chief investment officer of chicago-based kemper financial services inc .
but most advisers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand pat . `` when you see a runaway train , '' says steve unk , partner in the san francisco investment advisory firm brouwer & unk , `` you wait for the train to stop . ''
even for people who expect a bear market in coming months -- and a sizable number of money managers and market unk do -- the advice is : wait for the market to bounce back , and sell shares gradually during rallies . the best thing individual investors can do is `` just sit tight , '' says marshall b. front , executive vice president and head of investment counseling at stein roe & unk inc. , a chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $ 18 billion .
on the one hand , mr. front says , it would be unk to sell into `` a classic panic . '' on the other hand , it 's not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy . `` this is all unk right now , and when unk starts to run , it can run further than anyone anticipates , '' he said . `` so it 's more prudent to wait and see how things stabilize . ''
roger unk , professor of finance at yale university and head of the market information firm unk associates inc. , says , `` my real advice would be to just ride through it . generally , it is n't unk to be in and out '' of the stock market .
mr. unk thinks that this week is `` going to be a unk week . '' but he also thinks it is `` a good week to consider buying . ''
john unk , former president of the los angeles chapter of the national association of investors corp. , an organization of investment clubs and individual investors , says his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of 1987 , and see no reason to sell now . `` we 're dedicated long-term investors , not traders , '' he says . `` we understand unk and euphoria . and we hope to take advantage of unk and buy stocks when they plunge . ''
one camp of investment pros sees what happened friday as an opportunity . over the next days and weeks , they say , investors should look for stocks to buy .
friday 's action `` was an old-fashioned panic , '' says alfred goldman , director of technical market analysis for a.g. edwards & sons in st. louis . `` stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price . '' his advice : `` you ought to be there with a basket unk them . ''
james craig , portfolio manager for the unk unk fund , which has one of the industry 's better track records , started his buying during friday 's plunge . stocks such as unk foods corp. , unk stores inc. , american international group inc. and federal national mortgage association became such bargains that he could n't resist them , he says .
and mr. craig expects to pick up more shares today . `` it will be unk at first , but i would not be buying if i thought we were headed for real trouble , '' he says . he argues that stocks are reasonably valued now , and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of 1987 .
mr. front of stein roe suggests that any buying should `` concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side , or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction . '' his firm favors selected computer , drug and unk stocks .
other investment pros are more pessimistic . they say investors should sell stocks -- but not necessarily right away . many of them stress that the selling can be unk , gradual , and done when stock prices are unk .
on thursday , william unk , a seattle money manager , used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline . he thinks the underlying inflation rate is around 5 % to 6 % , far higher than most people unk .
in the pension accounts he manages , mr. unk has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks , partly as an inflation hedge . he thinks government officials are unk to let a recession start when government , corporate and personal debt levels are so high . so he thinks the government will unk on the side of unk inflation .
as a result , mr. unk says , `` i think the ball game 's over , '' and investors are about to face a bear market .
david m. jones , vice president at unk g. unk & co. , recommends treasury securities ( of up to five years ' maturity ) . he says the oct. 6 employment report , showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector , is a warning sign to investors .
one strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their unk is to buy `` put '' options , either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index . a put option gives its holder the right ( but not the obligation ) to sell a stock ( or stock index ) for a specified price ( the strike price ) until the option expires .
whether this insurance is unk depends on the cost of an option . the cost , or premium , tends to get fat in times of crisis . thus , buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk .
the prices of puts generally did n't soar friday . for example , the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on eli lilly & co. moved up from 3 % at thursday 's close to only 3.3 % at friday 's close , even though the shares dropped more than $ unk . but unk prices may unk when trading unk today .
it 's hard to unk about a reasonable price for puts . but investors should keep in mind , before paying too much , that the average annual return for stock holdings , long-term , is 9 % to 10 % a year ; a return of 15 % is considered unk . paying , say , 10 % for insurance against losses takes a deep unk out of the return .

unk banker commercial group said it sold $ 47 million of common stock to its employees at $ 10 a share , giving them a total stake of more than 40 % in the commercial real estate brokerage firm .
the firm , which was acquired in april from sears , roebuck & co. in a management-led buy-out , had planned to sell up to $ unk million of stock , or a 50 % stake in the company , to its 5,000 employees .
though the offering did n't sell out , james j. unk , chairman and chief executive officer , said , `` we 're pretty proud of the employees ' response . '' he noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan , where a company usually unk money from third party lenders to buy stock that it sets aside to award employees over time , here employees had to unk out their own cash for the stock . `` they came up with their own money instead of borrowed money , '' mr. unk said . `` it 's totally different . ''
he said the offering was designed to create long-term incentives for employees . `` we 're in a service business , and in that context , it 's vital to have your employees involved in the ownership so they have a stake in the success . '' the brokerage firm wo n't pay a dividend on the stock .
employees have the right to trade stock among themselves , and the company will establish an internal clearing house for these transactions . they may also eventually sell the shares to third parties , but the outside investors who own the remaining 60 % of unk banker have the right to first refusal .
those outside investors in unk banker include unk group , a closely held washington , d.c. , merchant banking firm whose unk is frank unk , former secretary of defense ; unk v. unk , senior adviser to unk group ; mellon family trust of pittsburgh ; westinghouse credit corp. , the financial services unit of westinghouse electric corp. ; bankers trust co. , a unit of bankers trust new york corp. ; and a group of japanese investors represented by the investment banking unit of tokyo-based unk bank . bankers trust and unk financed the $ 300 million acquisition from sears roebuck . unk banker also named three outside director nominees for its 17 member board . the nominees are gary wilson , chief financial officer of walt disney co. ; james montgomery , chief executive officer of great western financial corp. ; and peter unk , former commissioner of baseball and now a private investor .
the first major event this morning in u.s. stock and futures trading may be a unk at the chicago mercantile exchange .
under a reform unk from the 1987 crash , trading in the merc 's stock-index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from friday 's close , a move equal to 40 points on the dow jones industrial average . the aim of the unk would be to ease the opening of the new york stock exchange , which would be unk by such a volatile move on the merc .
that unk unk is just one of a number of unk adopted after the 1987 crash . the big board also added computer capacity to handle huge unk in trading volume . several of those post-crash changes kicked in during friday 's one-hour collapse and worked as expected , even though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge . but the major `` circuit breakers '' have yet to be unk . a deeper market plunge today could give them their first test .
a further slide also would unk debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash . most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the brady task force , which unk the 1987 crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the treasury secretary . the most controversial of the brady recommendations involved establishing a single unk regulator to handle crucial unk questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets .
but for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended . big board and merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the merc 's standard & poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` unk '' communications among exchanges . those unk -- from unk p.m. to unk p.m. unk and from unk p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels .
during the first halt , after the s&p index had fallen 12 points , the big board 's `` unk '' computer program automatically was triggered . that system is designed to separate unk program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks .
one merc broker compared the action in the s&p pit during the two unk to a fire at a unk school . `` you do n't want the fire but you know what to do , '' said howard unk , an independent floor broker and a merc governor . `` there was no panic . the system worked the way we devised it to work . ''
after unk for about 15 minutes , the s&p index tumbled to its unk limit and the second freeze went into effect . traders then spent the last half-hour `` watching to see if the dow would drop 250 points , '' mr. unk added , referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour . one unk estimated that 80 % to 90 % of the s&p traders `` were just standing around watching . ''
but the unk circuit breaker never had to kick in , and unk on the chicago board of trade 's major market index also were n't triggered . the unk and the s&p 500 are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies . the programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the 1987 crash .
the process of post-crash reforms began with calls to unk the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments .
in october 1987 , just after the market drop , washington was unk in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated . over the next year that grand agenda was unk down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by unk trading to give market players time to unk and reconsider positions . in addition , limits were placed on computer-driven trading , and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets . few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated .
at the unk the prime target was program trading , which was much discussed but little understood on capitol hill . there were also calls to strip the stock markets of `` derivative '' products , such as stock-index futures and options , which federal judge stanley unk , for example , unk to `` unk attached to the basic market . '' and there was much criticism of the new york stock exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers .
when the brady task force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in january 1988 , it immediately unk the reformers ' agenda . arguing that the separate financial unk acted as one , and unk that the crash had `` raised the possibility of a unk financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task force called for establishing a unk to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unk clearing systems and to install circuit breakers .
only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented . the reagan white house held the brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the working group on the financial markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies . in may 1988 , the working group , made up of representatives from the federal reserve , the treasury , the securities and exchange commission , and the commodity futures trading commission , finally endorsed only circuit breakers .
after several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets , circuit breakers were set in place , with the most notable unk trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the dow jones industrial average . privately , some free unk dismissed such unk as unk to unk . after all , this free-market argument went , the dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century .
`` circuit breakers '' set to soften big drops :
-- if s&p futures fall 5 points at opening , contract trading unk for 10 minutes .
-- if dow industrials fall 25 points at opening , contract trading unk for 10 minutes .
-- if s&p futures fall 12 points ( equivalent to about 100 points on unk ) , trading is frozen for half hour to that price or higher . on nyse program trades are diverted into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell orders .
-- if s&p futures fall 30 points , trading is restricted for an hour to that price or higher .
-- if dow industrials fall 250 points , trading on the big board unk for an hour . s&p and unk contracts also halt .
-- if unk drops 400 points , big board unk trading for two hours . trading in unk and s&p futures also halted .
brady task force recommendations ( jan. 1988 ) :
-- establish an unk regulator for financial markets
-- unk unk systems
-- make margins consistent across stock and futures markets
sec proposals ( may 1988 ) :
-- require prompt reports of large securities trades .
-- give sec authority to monitor unk by affiliates of brokerage firms .
-- transfer jurisdiction over unk futures to sec from cftc . ( opposed by new sec chairman ) -- give sec authority to halt securities trading , ( also opposed by new sec chairman ) .
congressional proposal :
-- create a task force to review current state of the securities markets and securities laws .
breaking the soviet government 's television monopoly , an independent company has gained rights to show world programming , including american films .

a nato project to build a unk for the 1990s was unk by the unk of three of its eight participating nations . britain , france and italy announced technical reasons for unk , but some officials pointed to growing reluctance among the allies to commit themselves to big defense spending while unk unk talks show signs of success .
small wonder that britain 's labor party wants credit controls . a few hours after the party launched its own unk credit card earlier this month , the unk raised the nation 's base interest rate . labor 's visa card is believed to be the first linked to a british political party . labor gets 25 pence ( 39 cents ) for every 100 ( about $ 155 ) that a user charges to the card . as with other plastic in britain 's unk environment , the labor card , unk by unk bank , carries a stiff ( in this case , unk % ) annual rate on the unpaid balance .
china 's unk unk program has achieved some successes in unk runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an unk drain on state budgets .
the official china daily said retail prices of unk foods have n't risen since last december but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down . the state statistical bureau found that more than 1 billion unk ( $ 270 million ) was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies .
the newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unk '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget . ''
the aim of the unk measures was to unk economic growth , which soared to unk % last year , to 8 % in 1990 . economists now predict the growth rate will be about 11.5 % for the year .
in a sign of growing official unk for unk , russian orthodox unk were allowed to unk the unk anniversary of the moscow unk in the kremlin 's unk unk unk , where unk were unk ... . a unk , $ 7.7 million unk of unk was completed on a hill outside hong kong , facing china . the unk is the unk of unk unk unk , director of the unk lin unk , who said : `` hong kong is such a unk place , we also need some kind of unk symbol . ''
it all seemed innocent enough : last april , one steven b. unk visited unk products inc. here , identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the little company 's new unk players for children .
`` it is almost identical to the sony product , '' mr. unk unk , after seeing unk and pictures . replied a unk salesman : `` exactly . '' the unk merchandise carried wholesale prices some 40 % below those of sony corp. of japan 's `` my first sony '' line . the unk unk enthusiastic and promised to return .
but instead of a new customer -- part of a unk unk from unk sony -- unk got a costly legal unk . mr. unk , it turned out , was a private unk using a hidden tape unk to gather information for sony . his recording later turned up as a court exhibit . seeking to keep unk 's `` my own '' product line off the u.s. market , sony last may filed a suit in manhattan federal court unk the unk of trademark unk , unfair competition and other violations of business law .
since then , life has changed a lot for unk leonard unk , unk 's owner . `` i have n't been able to get a decent night 's sleep since this has been going on , '' he says . `` it 's the most unk thing in my life -- i ca n't even attend to my business . '' his company ( annual sales : about $ 25 million ) may suffer a costly blow -- losing an estimated 10 % of total sales -- if sony ( annual sales : about $ 16 billion ) unk . unk 's plight shows what can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a unk multinational .
with considerable irony , the case also shows how completely japan has turned the tables on u.s. business . americans used to complain bitterly about being unk by unk products from japan . now sony , whose innovative , unk products are among the most unk in consumer electronics , is bitterly complaining about a little u.s. firm with a cheap unk produced in china .
`` the unk of this is that unk knocked off the sony line and sony wants to stop it , '' says lewis h. unk , sony 's attorney , who previously unk unk 's unk . ( sony itself declines to comment . ) if sony wins , mr. unk says , its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas . at worst , he adds , `` they 'd have to unk them all up and throw them away . ''
mr. unk denies the suit 's charges and says his only mistake was taking on sony in the marketplace . `` i made a similar line and i produced it cheaper , '' he says .
today , u.s. judge john e. unk is expected to rule on sony 's renewed request for a pre-trial order blocking sale of the disputed products , on which deliveries began in july . the judge turned down an earlier sony request for such an order -- a decision upheld on appeal -- but sony returned with additional evidence and arguments .
though hoping to settle the case , unk unk to fight on , if necessary . but the battle is more than unk unk for . `` i had no idea i was getting in so deep , '' says mr. unk , who founded unk in 1982 . mr. unk had sold unk inc. , a taiwan electronics maker , and retired , only to find he was unk . with unk , he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in hong kong , beginning with unk mouse unk . the company has grown -- to about 40 employees , from four initially , mr. unk says . unk has been profitable since 1986 , adds the official , who shares his office with numerous teddy bears , all samples from his line of unk toys .
like many others , mr. unk took notice in 1987 when sony , in a classic example of market unk , changed the plastic skin and unk on the famous unk line of portable audio equipment and created the my first sony line for children . the unk unk new products looked more like toys than the adult models . ( in court papers , sony says it has spent more than $ 3 million to promote the line , with resulting sales of over a million units . )
sony found a new market niche , but mr. unk figured that its prices left plenty of room for a unk competitor . his products are n't exact copies of sony 's but strongly resemble them in size , shape and , especially , color . sony uses mostly red and blue , with unk of yellow -- and so does unk , on the theory that kids prefer these colors . ( `` to be successful , a product can be any color unk , as long as it is unk red , '' says charles e. unk , unk 's attorney . )
by last winter , unk was showing unk at toy unk in hong kong and new york -- and sony noticed . indeed , concerned that sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other unk -- such as unk desirable sony products -- against unk 's customers , mr. unk fired off a letter to sony in april . he himself threatened to take the matter to the federal trade commission or u.s. justice department . but unk has n't pursued those charges ( which were without merit , according to mr. unk , the sony attorney ) . recalls mr. unk : `` our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone . we never intended taking on sony -- we do n't have the resources . ''
sony answered the empty threat with its real suit . off and on since then , the companies have unk in court . and unk , in a news release , says , `` once competitive , sony now resorts to unk tactics in american unk to unk out and protect niche markets . ''
sony 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics -- including the use of a private unk unk as a buyer -- are routine in such matters . he also insists that sony , no less than others , has a legal right to protect its `` trade dress , '' in this case , mostly the colors that it claims make my first sony products unk . ( unk claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before sony entered the children 's market . )
whatever its merits , sony 's aggressive defense is unk for unk . it 's also costly . mr. unk says he has paid more than $ 70,000 in legal fees so far .
of sony , mr. unk says : `` they know there 's no way for them to lose . they just keep unk me in deeper until i reach the point where i give up and go away . '' for now , though , he unk to hang in .
unk charles h. unk ii , chairman of unk corp. , purchased unk shares , or 4.9 % , of unk 's common , according to a filing with the securities and exchange commission .
the stock was bought on thursday in a privately negotiated transaction , the filing said .

giant group ltd. said it terminated negotiations for the purchase of unk airways , a unk regional carrier that operates the united express unk service under contract to ual corp. 's united airlines .
giant , a beverly hills , calif. , collection of companies that is controlled by hollywood producer burt sugarman , did n't give a reason for unk its plan to acquire the airline , and unk officials could n't be reached for comment .
giant agreed last month to purchase the carrier . giant has n't ever disclosed the proposed price , although unk inc. , an arlington , unk aircraft consulting concern , has valued unk 's fleet at about $ 46 million .
the airline would have become the latest in a unk unk of giant companies , which are involved in making cement , recycling newsprint and operating fast-food restaurants .
the state-controlled insurer assurances unk de france said it has obtained regulatory approval to increase its stake in the financial holding company cie. de navigation mixte above 10 % from the current level of about 8 % .

unk did n't comment officially on its reasons for seeking the approval , but people close to the group said it was done to make sure the group would have the flexibility to increase its stake in the future , should interesting price opportunities arise .
an unk official did specify , however , that there was no foundation to recent rumors the group might be acting in concert with paribas .
lockheed unk systems co. , a unit of lockheed corp. , said it agreed to join with unk s.p . a. of unk , italy , to propose a new generation of jet unk for the u.s. air force .

striking auto workers ended their unk unk of a metal shop at a unk s.a. factory in eastern france friday as pay talks got under way in the capital .
but the unk breakthrough came as a nationwide dispute by finance ministry employees disrupted border unk and threatened the government 's ability to pay its bills .
the unk unk began filing out of the shop , which makes auto parts , at the plant in unk after voting unk to unk to abandon the unk .
their withdrawal was based on promises by unk to open negotiations in paris at the same time the last man left the premises .
the strike by customs officers , tax collectors , treasury workers and other civil unk attached to the ministry of finance may pose a more serious challenge to the government and the average unk . ministry employees complain that they are poorly paid because of a complex unk system they say fails to take into account their education and level of technical expertise .
the market for $ 200 billion of high-risk junk bonds , battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year , practically unk friday .
trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds , only to find themselves unk by potential buyers . stunned , they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades .
`` the junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there are no bids , only offers , '' says independent investor martin d. unk , who manages nearly $ 4 billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund . this unk is `` far from over , '' he says .
junk 's collapse helped unk the unk selling of stocks that produced the unk one-day dive in the dow jones industrial average since the oct. 19 , 1987 , crash . simultaneously , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the u.s. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the unk securities they could find .
but `` an unk unk unk '' the junk market friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says john unk , an economist at moody 's investors service inc . for example , the price of unk corp. 's $ 500 million of 16 3\/4 % bonds due unk -- sold less than two years ago by goldman , sachs & co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar . but not even goldman would make a market in the securities of unk , the owner of the nationwide chain of unk convenience stores that is strapped for cash . goldman officials declined to comment .
junk bonds , which unk from less than $ 2 billion at the start of this decade , have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments . the shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from campeau corp. , which created its u.s. retailing empire with junk financing . campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be unk on some interest payments and to put its prestigious unk department-store chain up for sale .
now , dozens of corporations , including unk allen , tw services and york international , that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs unk , may never get the money . `` the music has stopped playing , '' says michael unk , a principal in the investment firm of levy unk . `` you 've either got a chair or you do n't . ''
in friday 's aftermath , says r. douglas unk , a director of high-yield finance at first boston corp. , `` much of the $ 7 billion forward calendar could be deferred , depending on the unk . '' in august , first boston withdrew a $ 475 million junk offering of ohio unk bonds because potential buyers were `` very unk . ''
the outlook `` looks shaky because we 're still waiting '' for mutual funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off unk by individual investors , says king unk , senior vice president at unk , unk & unk , an investment arm of xerox financial services . indeed , a moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of 24 high-yield mutual funds declined for the unk consecutive day friday .
in a stark contrast , the benchmark 30-year treasury bond climbed more than 2 1\/2 points , or about $ 25 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 103 unk , its biggest gain of the year . the bond 's yield dropped to unk % , the lowest since march 31 , 1987 , according to technical data global markets group . the yield on three-month treasury bills , considered the unk of all investments , plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to unk % , the largest one-day decline since 1982 .
the main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190.58-point drop in the dow jones industrial average . `` when you get panic in one market , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said maria unk , money market economist at drexel burnham lambert inc .
nevertheless , the problems of the junk market could prompt the federal reserve to ease credit in the months ahead . `` this marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook , '' says william sullivan , director of money market research at dean witter reynolds inc. , new york .
any sustained unk could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities . robert dow , a partner and portfolio manager at lord , unk & co. , which manages $ 4 billion of high-yield bonds , says he does n't `` think there is any fundamental economic unk { for the junk bond unk } . it was unk unk . ''
he adds : `` the junk market has unk some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets unk that means the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk . i do n't believe that 's the case , but i believe that people are running scared . there is a flight to quality , and the quality is not in equities and not in junk -- it 's in treasurys . ''
even as trading in high-yield issues unk up over the past month , corporations sold more than $ 2 billion of new junk bonds . for example , a recent $ 375 million offering of unk gas services l.p. bonds sold by first boston was three times oversubscribed . a $ 550 million offering of turner broadcasting system inc . high-yield securities sold last week by drexel was increased $ 50 million because of strong demand .
first boston estimates that in november and december alone , junk bond investors will receive $ 4.8 billion of coupon interest payments . `` that 's a clear indication that there is and will be an unk of basic business going on , '' says mr. unk of first boston .
`` i do n't know how people can say the junk bond market unk when there were $ 1.5 billion of orders for $ 550 million of junk bonds sold last week by turner , '' says raymond unk , unk of merchant banking at merrill lynch & co . `` when the rally comes , insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will . there is plenty of money available from people who want to buy unk deals ; it 's the stuff that 's financed on a unk that people are wary of . ''
but such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have unk this year , casting a pall over much of the junk market . michael unk , director of fixed-income research at kemper financial services , says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer , contributing to the slide in prices .
`` last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals , '' he says . `` this year , at best , it 's in one in every five or six . and our credit standards have n't changed one unk . '' however , mr. unk said the slide in junk is creating `` one hell of a buying opportunity '' for selective buyers .
for the moment , investors seem more unk with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk . `` the market has been weak since '' the announcement of the campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by olympia & york , says mr. unk of merrill lynch . `` that really affected the market in that people started to ask ` what else is in trouble ? ' ''
well before campeau , though , there were signs that the junk market was unk through one of its worst years ever . despite the relatively strong economy , junk bond prices did nothing except go down , unk by a seemingly endless trail of bad news :
-- in june , two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ 1.2 billion of speculative debt securities , new york-based integrated resources inc. said it ran out of borrowed money .
-- in july , unk corp. , the dallas-based real estate and financial services company with about $ 1.3 billion of junk bonds , voluntarily filed for protection under u.s. bankruptcy law . -- by the end of july , the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven-year treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points .
-- in august , resorts international inc. , which sold more than $ 500 million of junk bonds , suspended interest payments .
-- in september , just as the cash squeeze hit campeau , unk financial corp. defaulted on $ 145 million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $ 1.2 billion of debt securities .
meantime , regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of unk . moody 's says the unk of corporate credit unk is the highest this year since 1982 . in addition , there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981 , according to the federal deposit insurance corp .
`` the era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it , '' says james grant , editor of grant 's interest rate unk , an early critic of the junk bond market . `` what we 've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying unk compound interest . businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings . what we 're seeing now is the unk unk of asset values to a future when unk debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy . ''
friday 's market activity
prices of treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a unk stock market .
the benchmark 30-year treasury bond was quoted 6 p.m. edt at 103 unk , compared with 100 unk thursday , up 2 1\/2 points . the yield on the benchmark fell to unk % , the lowest since march 31 , 1987 , according to technical data global markets group .
the `` flight to quality '' began late in the day and followed a unk fall in the stock market . treasurys opened lower , reacting unk to news that the producer price index -- a measure of inflation on the wholesale level -- accelerated in september . bond prices barely unk until midday .
many bond market participants will be closely unk the action of the federal reserve , which might repeat its october 1987 injection of huge amounts of liquidity to unk the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession .
prices of municipals , investment-grade unk and mortgage-backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their treasury counterparts .
mortgage securities rose in unk trading , with most of the activity concentrated in government national mortgage association 9 % coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue .
the ginnie mae november 9 % issue ended at 98 unk , up 7\/8 point on the day , to yield about unk % to a 12-year average life assumption .
investment-grade corporate bonds were up about 1\/2 to 3\/4 point . but the yield spread between unk , investment-grade issues and unk bonds widened .
and the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ 3 billion bond offering by the tennessee valley authority .
despite rumors that the tva 's long-awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets , sources in the underwriting syndicate said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled .
one of the sources said the smaller portions of $ 750 million each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been `` substantially oversubscribed . ''
municipal bonds rose as much as 3\/4 point .

friday 's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come unk the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 october crash , and unk have been put in place to keep markets more unk . still , the lesson is about the same : on friday the 13th , the market was spooked by washington .
the consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the ual takeover , and it 's certainly true the unk began immediately after the ual trading halt . still , the consensus seems almost as wide that one unk bid is no reason to write down the value of all u.s. business . this unk leads us to another piece of news moving on the dow jones unk shortly before the downturn : the success of senate democrats in unk the capital gains tax cut .
the real value of all shares , after all , is directly unk by the tax on any profits ( all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' ) . and market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the house last month . an hour before friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with $ 5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut .
there is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for unk the garbage out of the reconciliation bill . it would be a good thing if congress started to decide issues unk on their individual merits without unk . for one thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an unk vote . since senate leaders have so far unk it up with procedural unk , promises of a cleaner bill are suspect . especially so since president bush has been weakened by the panama unk .
to the extent that the ual troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of washington 's unk fingers . as the best opportunities for corporate unk are exhausted of course , at some point the market will start to reject them . but the airlines are unk a clear case , given anti-takeover unk by secretary of transportation skinner , who unk to believe safety will be unk if unk and british airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes .
worse , congress has started to jump on the skinner unk . james unk , the minnesota democrat who chairs the public works and transportation committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an unk takeover bill on unk speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the american and united air lines bids . it would give mr. skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any u.s. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more . so the ual deal has problems , and the market loses 190 points . unk , mr. secretary and mr. congressman .
in the 1987 crash , remember , the market was shaken by a unk unk proposal to tax takeovers out of unk . even more important , in our view , was the treasury 's threat to unk the dollar . the treasury is doing the same thing today ; unk , the dollar is not under unk pressure .
also , traders are in better shape today than in 1987 to survive selling unk . they are better capitalized . they are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape unk and clearing and settlement delays . the fed promises any needed liquidity . the big board 's unk with the chicago board of trade has improved ; it will be interesting to learn if `` circuit breakers '' prove to be a good idea . in any event , some traders see stocks as unk today , unlike 1987 .
there is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be unk by a little unk and common sense in washington . but on the bearish side , that may be too much to expect .
first chicago corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $ unk million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans .
the parent company of first national bank of chicago , with $ 48 billion in assets , said it set aside $ 200 million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries . the addition , on top of two big 1987 unk to unk reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling 79 % of unk and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations .
first chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $ 1.7 billion from $ 3 billion .
despite this loss , first chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital . during the quarter , the company realized a pretax gain of $ unk million from the sale of its first chicago investment unk unit .
combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ unk million from $ unk million . gains from first chicago 's venture capital unit , a big leveraged buy-out investor , rose 32 % to $ 34 million from $ unk million a year ago .
interest income and most fee income was strong .
greece 's second unk of general elections this year is slated for nov. 5 . for those hoping to see a unk of political unk restored -- in view of greece 's unk unk under unk unk and subsequent three-month unk with a unk coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : the scandals still unk former prime minister unk unk and his fallen socialist government are like flies unk around a unk unk .
in the unk round of voting , unk gave no clear mandate to any single political party . the ad interim coalition government that emerged from unk unk was , in unk , little more than the unk unk of ideological unk : on one side , the unk new democracy party , headed by unk unk . on the other , the so-called coalition of the left and progress -- a unk and rather deceptive title for a merger of the unk communist party of greece and its unk unk , the unk left .
the unk bond for this unk unk was plain : unk ( mr. unk 's party ) as common political enemy . the unk goal was a unk of government corruption , unk at all levels , but the main marks were mr. unk and his closest associates . in point of fact , this unk was overdue by decades . when reduced to unk status in unk unk unk , however , the notion unk into a promised assault , with targets primarily for political gains , not justice .
with regard to greece 's unk unk scandal , mr. unk 's principal unk remains george unk , former owner of the bank of unk and unk unk , now unk in a jail cell in unk , mass. , from where he is fighting unk proceedings that would return him to greece . mr. unk 's credibility is , at best , unk . he has ample unk to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than unk on numerous points . nevertheless , the new democracy and communist parties herald his unk as proof of unk unk .
among unk questions are whether mr. unk received $ 23 million of stolen bank of unk funds and an additional $ unk in unk , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ 57 million in mr. unk 's bank and then unk off the interest ; and , what unk 's cut was from the $ unk million mr. unk unk .
two former ministers were so heavily unk in the unk affair that unk members of parliament voted to refer them to the special court . but unk parliamentary probe was the case of millions of unk mr. unk unk into new democracy unk . in the end , the investigation produced only unk evidence and `` indications '' that point to unk , not unk proof .
on another issue , unk were told how their national intelligence agency , the unk , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and unk cabinet members . despite convincing arguments , it was never established that mr. unk personally ordered or directed the unk .
the central weakness of the `` scandals '' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and unk . the coalition government tried to show that unk ministers had received hefty sums for unk the purchase of unk fighting falcon and mirage 2000 combat aircraft , produced by the unk general dynamics corp. and france 's unk unk dassault , respectively . naturally , neither general dynamics nor dassault could be expected to unk its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid ( or not ) to various unk officials for services unk .
so it seems that mr. unk and his communist unk may have unk served mr. unk a moral victory on a unk : unk , whether guilty or not , can now unk the unk unk the whole affair as a unk hunt at mr. unk 's expense . but while unk high unk alone wo n't help unk regain power , mr. unk should never be unk . first came his predictable unk : he charged the coalition of the left and progress had sold out its leftist unk by unk in a unk plot aimed at unk unk and unk the course of socialism in greece .
then , to unk his credibility with the left , he unk some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the unk unk . next , he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel unk by the unk coalition 's birth -- by bringing into unk a unk communist party candidate . for balance , and in hopes of gaining some unk unk votes , he managed to attract a former new democracy party representative and known political enemy of mr. unk . thus unk heads for the polls not only with diminished unk , but also with `` unk of approval '' from representatives of its unk unk .
crucial as these elections are for greece , pressing issues of state are getting lost in the unk . the country 's future nato participation remains unk , for instance . greece also must unk major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened common market cooperation . greece 's unk relations with the u.s. need attention soon as well . for one , the current accord concerning u.s. military bases in greece unk in may 1990 . negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the june elections , but the clock is running .
another matter of concern is the unk of unk unk , a palestinian unk who is wanted in the u.s. for the 1982 unk of a pan american airways flight . the unk courts have decided in favor of unk in the unk case , but the matter unk final approval from greece 's next justice minister . the unk seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a unk test of whether greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism .
that unk could win the elections outright is unk ; the unk press , previously eager to palm off unk 's line , has turned on mr. unk with a unk unk . yet the possibility of another unk government is all too real . if mr. unk becomes the major opposition leader , he could unk a unk coalition . also , he could force new elections early next year by unk the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in march .
new democracy has once again unk unk the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against unk , unk to tend to either program unk or the unk of internal unk .

a federal appeals court in san francisco ruled that shareholders ca n't hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media unk revealed substantial information about the product 's flaws .
the ruling stems from a 1984 suit filed by shareholders of apple computer inc. , claiming that company officials unk investors about the expected success of the unk computer , introduced in 1983 .
lawyers specializing in shareholder suits said they are concerned that use of the `` press defense '' by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling .
according to the suit , apple officials created public excitement by touting unk as an office computer that would unk the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year . the plaintiffs also alleged that prior to the fanfare , the company circulated internal unk indicating problems with unk .
the suit claimed apple 's stock climbed to a high of $ unk a share on the basis of the company 's optimistic forecasts . but when the company revealed unk 's poor sales late in 1983 , the stock plummeted to a low of $ unk a share , according to the suit . the shareholders claimed more than $ 150 million in losses .
in 1987 , the san francisco district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently unk the company 's statements by unk consumers to unk 's problems .
late last month , the appeals court agreed that most of the case should be dismissed . however , it gave the shareholders the right to pursue a small portion of their claim that unk to unk 's disk drive , known as unk . the court ruled that the news media did n't reveal unk 's problems at the time .
lawyers are worried about the ruling 's unk in other shareholder suits but pointed out that the court stressed that the ruling should be regarded as very specific to the apple case .
`` the court was careful to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles and received the same attention as the company 's statements , '' said patrick unk , a los angeles lawyer at the firm of unk & unk , which was n't involved in the case . `` the court is saying that the adverse facts have to be transferred to the market with equal intensity and credibility as the statements of corporate insiders . ''
shareholders ' attorneys at the new york firm of unk , weiss , unk , unk & unk last week unk for a unk of the case . they wrote : `` the opinion unk a new rule of unk -- that if a wide variety of opinions on a company 's business are publicly reported , the company can say anything without fear of securities liability .

nfl ordered to pay $ 5.5 million in legal fees to unk
the national football league is considering appealing the ruling stemming from the u.s. football league 's largely unsuccessful antitrust suit against the nfl .
a jury in 1986 agreed with the unk 's claims that the nfl unk major league football . but the jury awarded the unk only $ 1 in damages , unk because of the antitrust claims .
last week , the u.s. court of appeals in new york upheld a $ 5.5 million award of attorneys fees to the unk league . unk d. unk , of unk & unk , then of unk , unk , unk , unk , unk , unk , unk & unk , was the lead trial lawyer , and his new firm pursued the application appeal . douglas r. unk of unk & unk says about $ 5.3 million of the award goes directly to the unk to unk it for fees already paid . unk & unk will get about $ unk for the costs of pressing the application .
the federal appeals court held that the nominal damages and the failure to prove all claims did n't exclude the unk from being unk . antitrust laws provide that injured parties may be unk for lawyers ' fees .
but unk unk , an attorney for the nfl , says his client will consider asking for another hearing or appealing to the u.s. supreme court . mr. unk , of unk , unk , slate , unk & unk in new york , says the ruling is wrong and the fee award is excessive because the unk lost its major claims , including its contention that the nfl unk trade through television contracts .
`` the unk was not the unk party , '' mr. unk insists .
unk alliance : unk & unk of houston and unk , robertson , fraser & hatch of calgary , alberta , are unk to help serve their unk clients . the unk is believed to be the first such cross-border arrangement among major law firms . the firms are n't required to refer work exclusively to each other and remain separate organizations . but they will work together on energy - , environmental - and unk issues and conduct unk on topics of mutual interest , said unk unk jr. of unk unk & unk . in addition , unk & unk 's washington , d.c. , office will play a key role as the firms work together on regulatory issues , particularly natural-gas exports , for their clients . the arrangement , reached after about eight months of negotiations , grew out of unk unk robertson 's desire to develop ties with a u.s. firm in light of unk trade barriers between the u.s. and canada , said francis m. unk of unk robertson .
in what may signal a turnaround for asbestos manufacturers , unk grace & co. won a 3 unk trial in pittsburgh over whether it should be required to remove asbestos unk from a local high school . mount lebanon high school , near pittsburgh , sought $ 21 million in unk damages from grace , arguing that the asbestos , which can cause unk diseases and lung cancer , posed a risk to students . grace successfully contended that removing the fire unk would pose a greater health risk than leaving it alone . a spokesman for the company said the verdict is thought to be the first in favor of an asbestos manufacturer where the unk was a school and the asbestos in question was used for unk .

roger unk , editor of u.s. news & world report , resigned friday from the weekly news magazine .
mr. unk said he resigned because of difficulties with unk between his home in new york and the magazine 's editorial offices in washington . `` frankly , i missed my family , '' said mr. unk .
in mr. unk 's tenure , the magazine 's advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly . but at 2.3 million weekly paid circulation , u.s. news still ranks third behind time warner inc. 's time magazine , with 4.4 million circulation , and washington post co. 's newsweek , with 3.3 million circulation .
unk b. unk , chairman and editor in chief , said mr. unk would be succeeded starting today by michael unk , the magazine 's executive editor , and merrill unk , a senior writer . mr. unk and ms. unk are married to each other . mr. unk said his magazine would maintain its editorial unk , which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with unk , unk articles .
mr. unk , a senior writer at time magazine before joining u.s. news & world report , said he had numerous job offers from other magazines while he was editor . the offers were to work as a writer , not an editor . he said he will now consider those offers .
unk unk unk aviation s.a. said group profit before taxes and contributions to employee unk soared 97 % to unk million francs ( $ unk million ) in the first half of 1989 from unk million francs a year earlier .
the french aircraft group pointed out , however , that financial results from its sector of industry are frequently unk because of unk cash flow from large contracts .
it noted , for example , that group revenue for the first half was unk billion francs , down about 12 % from unk billion francs a year earlier . still , it said it expects sales for all of 1989 to be on the order of 20 billion francs , reflecting anticipated billings for two large contracts in the second half of the year .
for all of 1988 , dassault had group profit of unk million francs on revenue of unk billion francs . the group has n't yet released earnings figures for the first half of 1989 , nor has it made a detailed forecast of its full-year earnings .
unk consolidated industries inc. expects to report earnings before extraordinary tax benefits of about $ 1.5 million , or about 41 cents a share , for the third quarter , compared with a loss last year , said glenn r. simmons , chairman and chief executive officer .
after a tax benefit of about $ unk , unk expects to report net income of $ 2.3 million , or about 62 cents a share , mr. simmons said . for third quarter last year , unk reported a $ 1 million loss from continuing operations and a $ 200,000 loss from discontinued operations , for a net loss of $ 1.2 million .
revenue for the latest third quarter was about $ unk million , up 10 % from $ unk million last year , he said .
mr. simmons said the results signal a turnaround for the maker of wire and wire products , which has struggled to remain competitive in the face of unk , imported steel . a new $ 46 million steel rod unk , which got off to a rocky start in early 1988 , now is running efficiently and a new management team is more heavily marketing unk 's products , mr. simmons said .
as a result , the company hopes to report net income for the year of about $ unk million , or about $ unk to $ unk a share , compared with a net loss of $ unk million last year , after a loss from discontinued operations of $ unk million . revenue for 1989 is expected to be about $ 300 million , up about 21 % from $ unk million in 1988 .
for the nine months ended sept. 30 , unk expects to report net income of $ unk unk , or about $ unk a share , after an extraordinary gain from $ 3.2 million in tax benefits . last year , the company had a net loss of $ 6.5 million , including a $ 6.1 million loss from continuing operations and a $ 400,000 loss from discontinued operations . revenue for the nine months is expected to be about $ unk million , up about 21 % from $ unk million last year .
mr. simmons said unk 's new mill is expected to produce about unk tons of steel unk this year , up from unk tons in 1988 . production at the mill has exceeded the ability of unk 's casting operation to supply it , he said , which will force unk to purchase unk , or unk steel bars , from outside the company during the fourth quarter and next year .
unk will have to consider expanding its casting operation , at an estimated cost of $ 8 million to $ 10 million , within the next 18 to 24 months , mr. simmons said .
under robert w. singer , who was named president and chief operating officer last year , unk has expanded its sales force to about 20 people from about 15 and hopes to expand its sales from the middle portion of the country toward the east and west unk .
`` prior to a year ago , unk was an unk . now i think we have a group of marketing people who are out selling to retailers and unk , '' mr. simmons said .
still , he said , the unk company plans to continue its unk strategy for its unk brand of unk wire unk and other products . the company claims a 40 % share of the u.s. field unk business , a 35 % share of unk unk sales and a 30 % share of unk wire sales .
freeport-mcmoran inc. said a temporary unk of operations at its unk bridge unk facility in unk , unk , will result in slight earnings improvement to both the company and its freeport-mcmoran resource partners limited partnership unit . the company did n't elaborate .
the diversified energy and minerals concern said that a depressed unk market is responsible for the temporary unk of the plant , but that the plant can be unk quickly when the market improves . more than 400,000 pounds of unk a year have been produced at the facility during the past seven years . a second unk plant at uncle sam , unk , that produces more than unk pounds of unk annually , will continue to operate .
freeport-mcmoran said the shutdown wo n't affect sales volumes under long-term sales contracts of its unk unk recovery co. unit , but will reduce the amount of product sold on the spot market . freeport-mcmoran resource partners , as owner of the unk technology , receives royalty payments .
business week subscribers may hear this week 's issue talking back to them .
a unk ad from texas instruments inc. , running in approximately unk issues of the oct. 20 `` corporate unk '' issue of the mcgraw-hill inc. publication , contains a speech unk unk between two of the pages . readers who pull off a piece of tape and press a switch will hear a tiny -- but unk unk -- voice announce , `` i am the talking chip , '' as it launches into a unk unk on its own attributes .
the talking chip is n't cheap -- the unk cost to texas instruments is about $ 4 , and that 's without adding in business week 's charge -- but texas instruments believes it is a first . previous efforts have included musical ads , featuring simple unk chips that play a tune , but the voice unk in this effort is much more sophisticated , with none of the unk unk that one unk , for example , when calling telephone directory services .
and for those who miss the message the first time around , not to worry : three tiny unk provide enough unk for as many as 650 unk .
unk financial corp. , dallas , said it will ask a u.s. bankruptcy court to allow it to hire lazard unk & co. to help it sell its leasing unit .
unk , unk by merrill lynch capital markets , has been trying to sell its equitable unk leasing co. for several months , apparently without success .
the real estate and mortgage banking concern had hoped to use proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt . without cash from asset sales and unable to reach a new unk agreement , unk defaulted on $ 145 million in notes that became due sept. 1 . it filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code sept. 24 to give it additional time to work on a plan to restructure its $ unk billion in senior debt .
unk said merrill lynch , which owns bonds and equity in unk , could n't continue as unk 's investment banker because it is also a creditor . it said it chose lazard in part because of lazard 's offices in europe and japan , where investors might be interested in a u.s. leasing company .
canadian imperial bank of commerce said it will increase its loan-loss provisions to cover all its loans to lesser developed countries , except mexico , resulting in an after-tax charge to 1989 earnings of 300 million canadian dollars ( us$ unk million ) .
don unk , senior vice president and chief unk , said the bank 's strong earnings enable it to be the first major canadian bank to set aside provisions covering all its c$ unk billion in unk unk debt .
`` it unk the continuing uncertainty with respect to the ultimate value of the loans , '' he said .
the bank said about c$ unk million will be added to its existing unk and general loss provisions in its fourth quarter , ending oct. 31 . mr. unk said the c$ 300 million charge to earnings would amount to about c$ unk a share . the bank 's net income for the nine months ended july 31 was c$ unk million , or c$ unk a share .
mr. unk said the bank will restructure its c$ unk million of mexican debt , of which c$ unk million is in mexican notes secured by u.s. government bonds . the bank has a 45 % reserve against the remaining c$ unk million of mexican debt and expects to swap that for other mexican notes supported by u.s. treasury zero-coupon bonds .
mr. unk said the bank 's experience with unk debt has been `` painful '' and this latest move represents the final phase of a program begun seven years ago to reduce its exposure through unk , debt sales and debt swaps . he said the bank will no longer participate in unk unk lending , but will support trade financing and other transactions that meet the bank 's standards .
the unk among takeover stocks friday does n't mean the end of unk but simply marks the start of a less ambitious game , wall street 's big-time deal makers say .
suitors from now on are more likely to be unk companies , rather than raiders or unk financiers . and they will be launching unk and perhaps fewer deals , now that it 's tougher to finance them .
this is an ominous sign for a stock market that lately has been fueled by takeover speculation and bidding wars for companies that put themselves up for sale . whenever the 1980s merger boom seems to be unk , shock waves unk through the stock market .
`` the market is unk , not cheap , '' says alan unk of the new york unk firm unk unk . he recently began increasing his cash position to 45 % of his portfolio . `` i look at where deals can get done , '' he says , `` and they 're not getting done '' at current prices .
lenders are growing increasingly nervous about unk takeovers , investment bankers say . `` you had a week of a deteriorating junk-bond market that ran unk into the news on friday about what appeared to be happening to the bank debt market , '' says steven unk , a partner and merger specialist with lazard unk & co .
trading unk up friday in the market for high-yield junk bonds , often used to finance takeovers . it was the latest in a series of setbacks for the junk bond market , where prices began weakening last month after campeau hit a cash crunch .
and banks appear to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests for high-risk takeover loans . the group trying to buy ual announced friday that it could n't arrange the $ 7.2 billion in bank loans it needs to buy the parent of united airlines for $ 300 a share .
takeover-stock traders today will be scrambling to learn of any ual developments , and other takeover stocks are likely to trade in unk . investment bankers representing the buy-out group and ual 's board spent a unk weekend trying to unk out new terms that would be more acceptable to the banks .
after ual , the stock viewed as most vulnerable is american airlines ' parent amr , the target of a $ unk takeover proposal from new york real estate developer donald trump . trading in amr shares was suspended shortly after 3 p.m. edt friday and did n't resume . before the halt , amr last traded at 98 5\/8 . late friday night , the london office of jefferies & co. , a los angeles securities firm , traded amr shares at prices as low as 80 . similarly , delta air lines and usair group dropped 10.1 % and 8.5 % , respectively , on friday and could weaken further .
over the unk , however , two developments in other deals indicated that unk banks and wall street firms still are willing to commit billions of dollars to finance takeover bids launched by major companies .
vitro s.a. , a major mexican glass maker , said yesterday that it agreed to buy unk glass container in a tender offer for $ unk a share , sweetened from the original $ unk offer vitro launched two months ago . on friday , unk shares fell 1 1\/4 to close at 18 1\/2 .
for the broader market , the greatest significance of the unk deal may be that it was put together late friday night -- after the market unk -- and involves a $ 155 million temporary `` bridge '' loan from donaldson , lufkin & jenrette securities and a $ unk million loan from security pacific national bank .
moreover , to complete the entire unk glass purchase and unk existing debt , donaldson said it is `` highly confident '' that it will be able to sell $ 400 million of junk bonds for vitro , despite the current disarray in the junk bond market . donaldson 's statement is n't merely an idle unk , because those bonds will have to be sold before donaldson 's bridge loan can be paid back . security pacific , meanwhile , said it expects to arrange $ unk million in bank loans for vitro .
in another takeover battle , a spokesman for mccaw cellular communications said yesterday that mccaw has been advised by three commercial banks that they remain `` highly confident '' they can arrange $ 4.5 billion of bank loans for mccaw 's tender offer for about 45 % of lin broadcasting , `` notwithstanding recent events . ''
mccaw is offering $ 125 a share for 22 million lin shares , thereby challenging lin 's proposal to spin off its television properties , pay shareholders a $ unk special dividend and combine its unk operations with bellsouth 's cellular business .
on friday , lin shares were among the few takeover issues that did n't fall much , dropping 5 1\/2 , or 4.9 % , to close at 107 1\/2 . traders and investment bankers said lin shares were n't hurt much because bellsouth is viewed as a unk corporate buyer unlikely to be affected by unk among bankers or bond buyers .
investment bankers interviewed over the weekend see a silver unk for the merger business in the stock-market drop . potential bidders for companies `` were saying that things were beginning to look expensive , '' says mr. unk of lazard .
`` nothing makes things look cheaper than a unk drop in the dow , '' mr. unk says . `` just as there are people waiting to become bargain unk in the stock market , there are people waiting to become bargain unk in the deal market . ''
investment bankers expect most of those bargain unk to be unk corporations .
`` in the past , corporate buyers were often unk from making bids because of competition from lbo firms , which were often prepared to unk '' the corporations , says j. unk hill , head of mergers and acquisitions at shearson lehman hutton . now , `` corporate buyers should be willing to unk the acquisition market because the competition from unk buyers has been reduced . ''
many takeover stocks plunged friday , as speculators retained their confidence in corporate buyers but fled from the unk unk stocks , the targets of rumored deals .
columbia pictures entertainment , which has agreed to a friendly $ unk bid from sony of japan , fell only 1\/8 to close at 26 5\/8 .
but several stocks long rumored to be unk for a takeover or restructuring fell 10 % or more . they include usx , down 11.7 % ; upjohn , down unk % ; campbell soup , down 11 % ; paramount communications , off unk % ; woolworth , down 10.2 % ; delta air lines , down 10.1 % , and mca , down 9.7 % .
the market -- and investment bankers -- are even less unk about companies that have had at least one bid , merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already . given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market , traders fear that these transactions may be revised yet again .
examples include unk , whose agreement to be acquired for $ 25 a share by unk collapsed last month . unk shares fell nearly 20 % on friday to close at 12 7\/8 .
ramada , which first delayed and then unk a $ 400 million junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring , fell 15.6 % to close at 9 1\/2 . ramada has said it hopes to propose a new restructuring plan but has n't indicated when it will do so .
shares of american medical international , which agreed last week to accept a lower price from a buy-out group that includes first boston corp. and the unk family of chicago , fell unk % on friday to close at 20 . the buy-out group is offering $ unk a share for 63 million american medical shares , down from its offer in july of $ 28 a share for unk million shares .
but investment bankers say the market may have unk some unk stocks . hilton hotels , for example , was among the unk issues , falling unk % to close at 85 , down 21 1\/2 on friday .
hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses . people familiar with hilton said over the weekend that the unk of the sell-off in hilton shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing . however , they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the ual buy-out group unk a general unk among banks to provide credit for unk takeovers .
hilton officials said they were n't worried about the drop in the company 's stock . william unk , hilton 's general counsel , said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are `` on track '' for what has been described previously as `` a slow and unk process . ''
`` i ca n't believe that any potential buyer for hilton would be affected by one day 's trading , '' mr. unk said .
but the stock market as a whole , bolstered as it is by takeover speculation , remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover financiers , both in the unk market and among commercial banks . for unk suitors , `` the takeover game has been over for some time , '' says new york money manager neil unk of unk capital , who has been keeping 85 % of his portfolio in cash . `` the market is just unk up to that point . ''

of all the one-time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm , few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease .
to take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms . it must also evaluate the real-estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective . specifically , it must understand how real-estate markets unk to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities .
when a regional economy unk cold , the local real-estate market gets unk . in other words , real-estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , unk much further than a local economy in recession . this was seen in the late 1960s in los angeles and the mid-1970s in new york . but the reverse is also true : when a region 's economy unk from a slowdown , these real-estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy .
why do local real-estate markets unk to regional economic cycles ? because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth .
metropolitan detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s , as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment . area employment dropped by 13 % from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14 % . however , the real-estate market was hurt even more . for example , residential building permits in the trough year of 1982 were off 76 % from the 1979 peak level .
once metropolitan detroit 's economy rallied in the mid-1980s , real estate rebounded . building permits , for example , soared a staggering 400 % between 1982 and the peak year of 1986 .
where , unk corporations and professional firms are now asking , are today 's opportunities ?
look no further than metropolitan houston and denver , two of the most depressed , overbuilt and potentially undervalued real-estate markets in the nation . of course , some observers have unk houston and denver for the past five years as a unk play . but now appears to be the time to act .
metropolitan houston 's economy did drop and then unk in the years after its 1982 peak . in the mid-1980s , employment was down as much as 5 % from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13 % .
the real-estate market suffered even more severe setbacks . office construction dropped 97 % . the vacancy rate soared more than 20 % in nearly every product category , and more than 30 % of office space was vacant . to some observers , the empty office buildings of houston 's `` unk unk '' were unk of a very troubled economy .
as usual , the real-estate market had unk . actually , the region 's economy retained a firm foundation . metropolitan houston 's population has held steady over the past six years . and personal income , after unk in the mid-1980s , has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms .
today , metropolitan houston 's real-estate market is poised for a significant turnaround . more than unk jobs were added in unk houston last year , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry . this growth puts houston in the top five unk areas in the nation last year . and forecasts project a 2.5 % to 3 % growth rate in jobs over the next few years -- nearly twice the national average .
denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has unk to the region 's economic trends , although denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as houston . by some measures , metropolitan denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years . its population has continued to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle . employment is now 4 % higher than in 1983 . buying income in real dollars actually increased 15 % between 1983 and 1987 ( the most recent year available ) .
the rates of increase , however , are less than the rapid growth of the boom years , and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy . in a unk unk , therefore , the region 's real-estate market all but collapsed in recent years . housing building permits are down more than 75 % from their 1983 unk .
although no one can predict when metropolitan denver 's real-estate market will rebound , major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned -- such as a new convention center , a major unk unk the metropolitan area , and a new regional airport . when denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will unk the general economic rebound .
what real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as houston 's or denver 's ? generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as washington , new york and los angeles . vacancy rates in the 15 % to 19 % range today may easily rise to the low to unk % range in a couple of years . under these conditions , even a unk out of economic growth -- `` unk cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the unk industry unk unk .
those looking for real-estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term ( three-year ) lease and wait for the bargains ahead .
mr. unk is managing partner of a real-estate advisory firm based in beverly hills , calif .
unk industrial corp. said it expects its third-quarter net earnings to be between two cents and four cents a share , compared with 61 cents a share a year ago . analysts had been projecting that the company 's earnings would be between 25 cents and 30 cents a share . the year-earlier third-quarter earnings amounted to $ 4.1 million .
the company said a drop in activity in the unk industry reduced sales volume at its two unk operations . also , the company said its commercial products operation failed to meet forecasts .
unk , a maker of unk truck and commercial unk equipment , said it expects its fourth-quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels , which are between 30 cents and 50 cents a share .
common cause asked both the senate ethics committee and the justice department to investigate $ 1 million in political gifts by arizona businessman charles keating to five u.s. senators who unk with unk regulators for him .
mr. keating is currently the subject of a $ 1.1 billion federal unk lawsuit unk him of unk off assets of a california thrift he controlled , lincoln savings & loan association , and driving it into unk .
fred unk -- president of common cause , the unk citizens lobby -- said mr. keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- democratic sens. dennis deconcini of arizona , alan cranston of california , john glenn of ohio and donald unk of michigan ; and gop sen. john unk of arizona .
mr. unk based this on a statement by mr. keating that was quoted in a wall street journal story in april : `` one question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause . i want to say in the most unk way i can : i certainly hope so . ''
in a highly unusual meeting in sen. deconcini 's office in april 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on lincoln . according to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators said lincoln was gambling unk with unk ' federally insured money and was `` a unk time bomb . '' mr. keating had complained that the regulators were being too unk .
the notes show that sen. deconcini called the federal home loan bank board 's regulations `` unk unfair , '' and that sen. glenn insisted that mr. keating 's thrift was `` viable and profitable . ''
for the next two years , the bank board , which at the time was the agency responsible for unk thrifts , failed to act -- even after federal auditors warned in may 1987 that mr. keating had caused lincoln to become insolvent . lincoln 's parent company , american continental corp. , entered bankruptcy-law proceedings this april 13 , and regulators seized the thrift the next day . the newly formed resolution trust corp. , successor to the bank board , filed suit against mr. keating and several others on sept. 15 .
mr. keating has filed his own suit , alleging that his property was taken illegally .
the cost to taxpayers of lincoln 's collapse has been estimated at as much as $ 2.5 billion .
details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years , mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers . in the midst of his 1988 re-election campaign , sen. unk , chairman of the senate banking committee , returned $ unk in contributions after a detroit newspaper said that mr. keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators .
sen. deconcini , after months of unk off intense press criticism , returned $ unk only last month , shortly after the government formally accused mr. keating of unk lincoln .
in addition , sen. unk last week disclosed that he unk had paid $ unk to american continental as unk for trips he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to mr. keating 's vacation home at cat unk , the unk , from 1984 through 1986 . sen. unk said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter `` fell between the cracks . ''
mr. keating , his family members and associates also donated $ unk to sen. unk 's congressional campaigns over the years , according to press accounts . but sen. unk says mr. keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987 , because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as mr. keating wanted . `` he became very angry at that , left my office and told a number of people that i was a unk , '' sen. unk recalls .
in july , california newspapers disclosed that mr. keating gave $ unk in corporate funds to three tax-exempt unk registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the unk of sen. cranston , who conceded that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing to do politically . '' in addition , sen. cranston received $ unk in campaign donations through mr. keating , and the california democratic party received $ unk in corporate donations for a 1986 unk drive that benefited the senator 's re-election campaign that year .
also in july , ohio newspapers disclosed $ 200,000 in corporate donations by mr. keating to the national council on public policy , a political committee controlled by sen. glenn . that was in addition to $ unk in direct campaign donations arranged by mr. keating to the ohio senator .
mr. unk said the senate ethics committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation , as was done in the case of former house speaker james wright . wilson unk , staff director of the ethics panel , would n't comment .
sen. unk said he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had been `` entirely proper . '' sen. unk said he had been `` deeply concerned '' at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper , but decided it was `` entirely appropriate '' for him to seek fair treatment for a unk .
sen. glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and `` i am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the senate ethics committee . '' sen. deconcini said , `` when all is said and done , i expect to be fully unk . ''
sen. cranston , who had already unk his help to the federal bureau of investigation in any investigation of mr. keating , portrayed his role in 1987 as unk regulators to act . `` why did n't the bank board act sooner ? '' he said . `` that is what common cause should ask be investigated . ''
trinity industries inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to manufacture 1,000 coal rail cars for norfolk southern corp . trinity estimated the value of the pact at more than $ 40 million .
trinity said it plans to begin delivery of the rail cars in the first quarter of 1990 . it said the 1,000 rail cars are in addition to the unk coal rail cars unk being produced for norfolk southern , a norfolk , unk railroad concern .
when china opened its doors to foreign investors in 1979 , toy makers from hong kong were among the first to march in .
today , with about 75 % of the companies ' products being made in china , the chairman of the hong kong toys council , dennis unk , has suggested a new unk label : `` made in china by hong kong companies . ''
the toy makers were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the british colony . but in the wake of the unk in beijing on june 4 , the hong kong toy industry is worrying about its strong unk on china . although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected by china 's political turmoil , they are looking for additional sites . the toy makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about china 's economic and political policies .
`` nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket , '' says david unk , chairman and chief executive officer of international unk group ltd .
indeed , unk and other leading hong kong toy makers were setting up factories in southeast asia , especially in thailand , long before the massacre . their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern china .
by diversifying supply sources , the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from china , manufacturers and foreign buyers say . it would n't be easy to unk quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern china during the past decade . a supply of cheap labor and the access to hong kong 's port , airport , banks and support industries , such as printing companies , have made china 's unk province a premier manufacturing site .
`` south china is the most competitive source of toys in the world , '' says henry unk , executive director of unk unk toys consolidated ltd .
hong kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border . in 1988 , exports of unk produced toys and games fell 19 % from 1987 , to hk$ unk billion ( us$ 1.29 billion ) . but unk , mainly from china , jumped 75 % , to hk$ unk billion . in 1989 's first seven months , domestic exports fell 29 % , to hk$ unk billion , while unk rose 56 % , to hk$ unk billion .
manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern china , where an estimated unk people are employed by the toy industry . `` for the next few years , like it or not , china is going to be the main supplier , '' says unk young , vice president of unk enterprises ltd. , one of the first big hong kong toy makers to move across the border .
in the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on southeast asia . several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in thailand , including unk , unk unk and unk industrial co. , the toy manufacturer headed by mr. unk . malaysia , the philippines and indonesia also are being studied .
with the european community set to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992 , several hong kong companies are beginning to consider spain , portugal and greece as possible manufacturing sites .
worries about china came just as hong kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major u.s. companies , unk of wonder inc. and unk industries inc . hong kong manufacturers say large debt unk and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties unk the local industry , causing it to unk credit policies and financial management . the industry unk last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results . still , they long for a `` unk '' toy to unk retail sales in the u.s. , hong kong 's biggest market for toys and games .
the closest thing the colony 's companies have to a u.s. unk this year is the unk unk unk unk series of action figures manufactured by unk holdings ltd . introduced in unk , the unk plastic unk are based on an american comic book and television series .
paul unk , managing director of unk , says 10 million unk unk have been sold , placing the unk unk among the 10 unk toys in the u.s . should sales continue to be strong through the christmas season , which accounts for about 60 % of u.s. retail toy sales , mr. unk said the unk unk could make 1989 a record sales year for unk .
other hong kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988 . besides the lack of a unk product , they cite the continued dominance of the u.s. market by unk entertainment system , an expensive video game made by unk co. of japan . unk buyers have little money left to spend on other products .
many of the toy makers ' problems started well before june 4 as a result of unk infrastructure and beijing 's unk programs launched late last year . toy makers complain that electricity in unk has been provided only three days a week in recent months , down from five days a week , as the province 's rapid unk has unk its generating capacity . manufacturers are upgrading unk power plants .
bank credit for china investments all but unk up following june 4 . also , concern exists that the unk beijing leadership will unk its control of unk , which has been the main laboratory for the unk policy and economic reforms .
but , toy manufacturers and other unk say beijing will be unk from tightening controls on unk southern china . they say china 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to unk production in unk . `` the chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports , '' says mr. unk of unk .
the bush administration , urging the supreme court to give states more leeway to restrict abortions , said unk have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents .
unk general kenneth unk argued that the 1973 supreme court decision , roe vs. wade , recognizing a constitutional right to abortion , was incorrect . he also argued that the high court was wrong in 1976 to rule that unk have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their parents .
the administration 's position was outlined in a unk brief filed in one of three abortion cases the supreme court will hear argued and will decide this term . the administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion .
the administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by chief justice william unk last july when the high court upheld missouri 's abortion restrictions . under that standard , which unk the votes of only three of the nine justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' unk for adopting it . that is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the supreme court 's test since 1973 , which requires a state to have a `` unk '' reason for unk abortion .
on the provisions of the minnesota law , the bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows unk to go to court for a judge 's permission instead .
the case , unk vs. minnesota , will be argued nov. 29 .
aluminum co. of america , hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas , said net income for the third quarter dropped 3.2 % to $ unk million , or $ unk a share .
the nation 's no. 1 aluminum maker earned $ unk million , or $ unk a share , a year earlier .
revenue rose 11 % to $ unk billion from $ unk billion .
analysts , who were expecting unk to post around $ unk to $ 3 a share , were surprised at the lackluster third-quarter results . `` it 's disappointing , '' said william unk , an analyst with smith barney , harris upham & co .
much of the earnings decline was led by unk rate adjustments , which affected the bottom line by $ unk million , or 17 cents a share , compared with $ 3.6 million , or four cents a share , the previous year .
lower prices for aluminum unk and certain unk products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings , the company said . `` in addition , costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant unk for unk work , '' the company said .
excluding the higher tax rate , which rose two percentage points to 38 % , and the negative exchange rate adjustment , the company would have met analysts ' expectations , said r. wayne unk , an analyst with goldman , sachs & co .
noting that the third quarter is usually the aluminum industry 's unk , mr. unk added , `` the third quarter is never a bang up period for them anyway . ''
nevertheless , the company said shipments were up slightly to unk metric tons from unk , unk the impact of the unexpected earning decline .
the results were announced after the stock market closed . in new york stock exchange composite trading friday , unk closed at $ 72 a share , down $ 4.75 , in a sharply lower market .
for 20 years , federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing parts of the television business . and for six years , nbc , abc and cbs have negotiated with hollywood studios in a unk attempt to change that .
but with foreign companies unk up u.s. movie studios , the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever . they hope the foreign deals will divide the hollywood opposition and unk congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from unk a piece of unk sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air .
even network executives , however , admit privately that victory -- either in congress or in talks with the studios -- is highly unk any time soon . and so the networks also are pushing for new ways to unk the `` unk '' provisions , known formally as the financial interest and unk rules .
that became clear last week with the disclosure that national broadcasting co. , backed by the deep pockets of parent general electric co. , had tried to help fund qintex australia ltd. 's unk $ 1.5 billion bid for mgm\/ua communications co . nbc 's interest may revive the deal , which mgm\/ua killed last week when the australian concern had trouble raising cash .
even if that deal is n't revived , nbc hopes to find another . `` our doors are open , '' an nbc spokesman says . nbc may yet find a way to take a passive , minority interest in a unk without violating the rules . and any nbc effort could prompt cbs inc. and abc 's parent , capital cities\/abc inc. , to look for ways of unk the unk regulations .
but the networks ' push may only unk an increasingly bitter rift between them and hollywood studios . both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing unk unk . few people unk to the talks expect the studios to unk .
the networks still are `` unk in their authority '' over what shows get on the air , charges motion picture association president jack unk , the most unk opponent of unk the rules . studios are `` unk '' to get shows in prime-time unk and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative unk sales , he contends . and that 's why the rules , for the most part , must stay in place , he says .
studio executives in on the talks - including officials at paramount communications inc. , unk entertainment inc. , warner communications inc. and mca inc. -- declined to be interviewed . but mr. unk , who represents the studios , asserts : `` the whole production industry , to a man , is on the side of preserving '' the rules .
such unk leave network officials all the more unk that the studios will unk . `` they do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate , '' says one network executive . `` and there 's no indication that washington is prepared to address the rules . that 's the problem , is n't it ? ''
indeed it is . congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess , urging the studios and the networks , which license rights to air shows made by the studios , to work out their own compromise .
but recent developments have made the networks -- and nbc president robert wright , in particular -- ever more unk that the networks must be unk to survive . the latest unk : sony corp. 's plan to acquire columbia pictures entertainment inc. for $ 3.4 billion , and to buy independent producer guber peters entertainment co. for $ 200 million .
`` i wonder what walter unk will think of the unk broadcast system unk evening news with dan rather broadcast exclusively from tokyo , '' wrote unk unk , an nbc vice president , in a commentary in last week 's issue of broadcasting magazine . in his article , mr. unk , who was in europe last week and unavailable , complained that the `` unk unk '' in unk rules have `` contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-u.s. enterprises . '' ( he did n't mention that nbc , in the meantime , was hoping to assist australia 's qintex in buying
an nbc spokesman unk that mr. unk 's unk was `` entirely consistent '' with nbc plans because the u.s. rules would limit nbc 's involvement in the qintex deal so severely as to be `` light years away from the type of unk deals available to sony -- and everyone else except the three networks . ''
the big three 's unk for deregulation began unk in the summer when the former time inc. went ahead with plans to acquire warner . although time already had a long-term contract to buy movies from warner , the merger will let time 's largely unk unk channel , home box office , own the warner movies aired on hbo -- a unk integration that is effectively blocked by unk regulations .
nbc 's mr. wright led the way in unk the networks ' inability to match a unk combination . he spoke up again when the sony bid for columbia was announced . since nbc 's interest in the qintex bid for mgm\/ua was disclosed , mr. wright has n't been available for comment . with a qintex deal , nbc would move into unk territory -- possibly raising unk at the studios and in washington .
`` it 's never really been tested , '' says william unk iii , who as a top cbs executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted . he now runs policy communications in washington , consulting to media companies . unk rules do n't unk block a network from buying a passive , small stake in a company that profits from the unk unk networks ca n't enjoy .
hence , nbc might be able to take , say , a 5 % stake in a company such as mgm\/ua . if the transaction raised objections , the studio 's unk operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake .
but such unk would still block the networks from unk a big chunk of the unk of unk . under current rules , even when a network fares well with a unk series -- abc , for example , made a killing in broadcasting its popular unk `` unk '' -- it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations . instead , abc will have to sell off the rights for a one-time fee .
the networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim -- for several years at the least .
six years ago they were unk close . the unk federal communications commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules . various evidence , including a unk institution study of some 800 series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s , showed the networks did n't unk unk control over the studios as had been alleged .
but just eight days before the rules were to die , former president ronald reagan , a one-time actor , unk on behalf of hollywood . the fcc effort collapsed .
the networks and studios have unk ever since . network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign unk builds more support in washington , but that seems unlikely . in congress , the issue unk : it 's about money , not program quality , and hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue .
a spokesman for rep. edward j. markey ( unk ) , who heads a subcommittee that oversees the fcc , says mr. markey feels `` the world has been forever changed by the unk deal . '' but he said mr. markey hopes this unk the networks and studios to work it out on their own . and at the fcc , meanwhile , new chairman alfred c. unk has said he wants the two sides to unk out their own plan .
recognition equipment inc. said it settled a civil action filed against it by the federal government on behalf of the u.s. postal service .
the government sued the company in april , seeking $ unk and other unspecified damages related to an alleged unk scheme . the suit named the company , former chief executive officer william g. moore jr. , former vice president robert w. unk and five defendants who were n't part of the company . the suit charged the defendants with causing peter e. unk , an unk of the postal service board of governors , to accept $ unk in unk , unk and unk . mr. unk was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined $ 11,000 for his role in the scheme .
in the agreement , recognition agreed to pay the government $ 20,000 in return for the release of all claims against the company , mr. moore and mr. unk . the five additional defendants were n't parties to the settlement .
a trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began sept. 27 in federal court for the district of columbia . they were indicted last october on charges of fraud , theft and conspiracy related to an effort to win $ 400 million in postal service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment . the company and its executives deny the charges .
in a related development , recognition equipment said the postal service has barred the company from bidding on postal contracts for an additional 120 days . the postal service originally suspended the company oct. 7 , 1988 , and has been renewing the ban ever since . the company said it will continue to pursue a unk of the suspension .
intel corp. reported a 50 % drop in third-quarter net income , partly because of a one-time charge for discontinued operations .
the big semiconductor and computer maker , said it had net of $ 72 million , or 38 cents , down 50 % from $ unk million , or 78 cents a share . the lower net included a charge of $ 35 million , equal to 12 cents a share on an after-tax basis , for the cost of unk a unk joint venture with unk ag of west germany . earning also fell from the year-ago period because of slowing unk demand . sales amounted to $ unk million , down 1.7 % from $ unk million .
intel 's stock rose in early over-the-counter trading friday , as investors appeared relieved that the company 's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter 's earnings of $ unk million , or 53 cents a share , and that sales actually exceeded the $ unk million for the second period . but intel later unk to the stock market 's plunge , closing at $ unk , down $ unk .
in august , intel warned that third-quarter earnings might be `` flat to down '' from the previous period 's because of slowing sales growth of its unk microprocessor , start-up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the company 's new 80486 chip in the current quarter .
on friday , andrew unk , intel president and chief executive officer , said `` intel 's business is strong . our bookings improved as the quarter unk and september was especially good . for the full quarter , our bookings were higher than the previous quarter , and our unk ratio exceeded unk . ''
for the nine-month period , intel reported net of $ unk million , or $ unk a share , down 27 % from $ unk million , or $ unk a share . revenue amounted to $ unk billion , up slightly from $ unk billion .
walter sisulu and the african national congress came home yesterday .
after 26 years in prison , mr. sisulu , the unk former unk of the liberation movement , was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up . at the same time , six anc colleagues , five of whom were arrested with him in 1963 and sentenced to life unk , were unk with their families at various places around the country .
and as the unk men returned to their homes , the anc , unk in south africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government , unk returned to the streets of the country 's black unk . a huge anc flag , with black , green and gold unk , was unk over the unk gate at mr. sisulu 's modest house , while on the street out front , boys displayed the anc colors on their shirts , unk and unk . at the small unk home of unk unk , a leading anc unk and a former unk in the group 's armed unk , unk we unk , unk stuck little anc unk in their hair and a man unk on an unk horn unk in anc unk .
`` i am happy to see the spirit of the people , '' said mr. sisulu , looking unk in a new gray suit . as the crowd outside his home unk `` anc , anc , '' the old man shot his unk into the air . `` i 'm inspired by the mood of the people . ''
under the laws of the land , the anc remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in unk , unk . but the unk release of the seven leaders , who once formed the intellectual and unk core of the anc , is a de unk unk of the movement and the unk of its internal unk .
`` the government can never put the anc back into the bottle again , '' said unk unk , a veteran unk activist on hand to welcome mr. sisulu . `` things have gone too far for the government to stop them now . there 's no turning back . ''
there was certainly no unk the tide of anc unk last night , when hundreds of people unk into the unk cross unk church in unk for what became the first anc rally in the country in 30 years . unk unk of `` anc '' and `` unk we unk '' shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the anc would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial unk on all fronts , including the armed struggle . and they called on the government to release nelson unk , the anc 's leading figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison . without him , said mr. sisulu , the unk of the others `` is only a unk . ''
president unk de unk released the anc men -- along with one of the founding members of the pan unk congress , a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government .
but pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this unk divided country . as other unk governments , particularly poland and the soviet union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control .
as the days go by , the south african government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued unk of mr. unk as well as the continued banning of the anc and enforcement of the state of emergency . if it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the anc , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to unk and unrest . if it does , the large number of unk whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their unk and threats to take matters into their own hands .
the newly released anc leaders also will be under enormous pressure . the government is watching closely to see if their presence in the unk leads to increased unk protests and violence ; if it does , pretoria will use this as a reason to keep mr. unk behind bars . pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life unk in the first place : for sabotage and conspiracy to unk the government .
in addition , the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the anc and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their unk . in order to head off any divisions , mr. unk , in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released , instructed them to report to the anc headquarters in unk as soon as possible .
the men also will be faced with unk the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many unk black unk , the so-called young unk who are anxious to see the old unk in action . says peter unk , president of the south african youth congress : `` we will be expecting them to act like leaders of the anc . ''
they never considered themselves to be anything else . at last night 's rally , they called on their unk to be firm , yet disciplined , in their opposition to apartheid . `` we unk discipline because we know that the government is very , very sensitive , '' said andrew unk , another early unk leader who is now 63 . `` we want to see nelson unk and all our unk out of prison , and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us . ''
there 's an intense debate in south korean president roh unk woo 's inner circle over his scheduled speech wednesday to a joint meeting of congress : should he give it in english or korean ?
it would be more effective with the u.s. politicians and public in english , the president 's foreign policy advisers argue . but , counter some domestic political aides , it would hurt mr. roh at home if he seems to be unk to the americans .
u.s. politicians and unk would do well to remember such unk pressures on the south korean president as they prepare for an important series of meetings with him this week . for unk korean relations , in economic and security terms , are at their most critical stage since the korean war .
when most americans think about south korea , they still unk up images of the war years , unk by the tv series unk . but south korea no longer is a unk , third world country . with a dynamic , growing economy , it is the u.s. 's unk trading partner . moreover , the korean unk remains one of the strategic unk points of east asia ; there are unk u.s. troops unk there . and the country is at a political unk now , as it unk with its new experiment in democracy .
south korea is `` unk important to us now , both economically and in terms of security , '' says sen. richard unk ( r. , ind. ) , the former chairman of the senate foreign relations committee . `` unfortunately , many americans do n't think much about korea . but the unk of their economic growth and the development of democracy -- unk though it is -- are very important to the united states . '' one major topic during mr. roh 's visit will be human rights . due process still is denied in south korea ; a few months ago , kim unk unk , the major opposition leader , was unk and unk for 20 hours by security unk . just as pope john paul ii did in seoul last week , president bush and members of congress ought to tell mr. roh in no uncertain terms that this kind of behavior is unk .
but context is important . south korea had a free election last year ; the liberals lost only because they could n't unk behind one candidate . moreover , there is a violent unk minority in south korea -- as demonstrated by the handful of radical students who broke into u.s. ambassador donald unk 's residence in seoul friday and unk it ( the ambassador and his wife were unk ) .
mr. roh , a former general and a member of the unk previous regime , has made impressive unk in supporting democratic values and institutions . it is n't a perfect democracy , but it 's a far cry from the unk rule of only a few years ago .
one thing that has n't changed in south korea is unk about north korea ; several people are being prosecuted for making unk visits to the communist north . but a visit to unk , where the constant tension between the communists and the joint unk korean forces is unk , makes it easier to understand these feelings . sometimes u.s. politicians forget that north korea , a country with a population of only 20 million , has an armed force of over one million troops , the sixth largest in the world .
whatever unk of change are unk through much of the communist bloc , they have n't reached unk . as long as it continues to pose a real threat , u.s. critics ought to go slow on demands to reduce troop levels in south korea .
the major topic when mr. roh calls on administration and congressional figures this week will be economics and trade . south korea hardly is without fault for trade unk with the u.s. ; most experts in the administration think that commerce secretary robert mosbacher got it exactly wrong a few months ago when he declared that south korea is more open economically than japan . on agricultural products in particular -- everything from beef to apples -- the koreans have unk to domestic political pressures for unk .
yet , earlier this year , south korea promised to make some real concessions on its investment laws and other trade unk . they enabled the country to avoid being targeted as an unfair trade partner under the tough `` unk unk '' section of the 1988 u.s. trade act . separately , as a result of the unk of the won and other measures , the almost $ 10 billion trade surplus the south koreans enjoyed with the u.s last year will be cut in half this year .
moreover , just a few days ago , the national assembly , with the governing and opposition parties in an unusual alliance , passed a resolution calling for a gradual opening up of south korean agricultural markets .
it 's appropriate for u.s. officials to keep unk for more open trade policies , as u.s. trade representative unk hills did in seoul last week . but there 's also sometimes a tendency in american political circles to pick especially on south korea , out of frustration over our inability to do much about japan . that 's unk .
most unk , it 's time for american unk to better appreciate that our economic future unk more with asia -- seoul as well as tokyo -- than unk else .
the u.s. always ought to stand up for its interests , but it 's essential that u.s. officials have an appreciation of the politics and history of our allies . in the upper unk of the roh unk woo 's government , they 're still unk about commerce secretary mosbacher 's trip to south korea earlier this year . it seems he learned , for the first time , that south korea had been occupied for decades by japan .
bolstered by a robust long-distance business , the telephone industry is expected to post a healthy profit increase for the third quarter .
analysts estimate that third-quarter earnings for the industry will increase as much as 19 % from the year-earlier period . if so , their cumulative earnings could hit $ unk billion .
most of the earnings growth , however , will come from the long-distance sector . american telephone & telegraph co. is expected to post a profit increase of about 18 % and mci communications corp. 's earnings are expected to surge 58 % .
united telecommunications inc. reported last wednesday that third-quarter net income climbed 75 % to $ unk million , or 90 cents a share , on revenue of $ unk billion . united unk 's unk unit posted operating profit of $ 60 million .
paul unk , a telecommunications analyst with bear , stearns & co. , said the long-distance companies have been buoyed by strong growth in the facsimile and unk business . he said declining long-distance prices also have helped stimulate usage .
the local telephone companies , however , are n't expected to fare as well . growth is predicted to be in the 1 % to 2 % range for most companies , with southern new england telephone and gte corp. posting profit increases in the neighborhood of 10 % .
`` the long-distance companies have kept their momentum , '' says robert morris iii , a telecommunications analyst with goldman , sachs & co. , `` while the pace of growth for the local telephone companies is slowing . '' that 's especially true for the regional bell companies .
he said regulation is primarily responsible for the bells ' unk earnings growth . most companies have reached their maximum allowed earnings unk , which are set by regulators . `` this signals the need for regulatory change , '' mr. morris said .
pacific telesis group , which is expected to post earnings of about 75 cents a share , obtained regulatory relief from california regulators last week . under the plan , the company is allowed to earn more if it can operate more efficiently . in the year-earlier quarter , pacific telesis earned $ unk million , or 75 cents a share , on revenue of $ unk billion .
analysts expect installations of new telephone lines to grow about 3 % . however , gte , bellsouth corp. and pacific telesis , which operate in unk with unk economies , are expected to report unk growth in the range of 4 % to 5 % . nynex corp. 's profits could begin to show signs of weakening from the effects of a nearly three-month strike , while other bell companies , such as unk and southwestern bell corp. , could be hurt in the quarter by one-time charges associated with the settlement of new union contracts .
mr. unk , the bear stearns analyst , said that generally , after eight weeks , `` a strike starts hurting earnings . i 'm waiting to see what the impact is on nynex . ''
analysts predict nynex earnings will be about $ unk a share , compared with $ unk a share a year earlier , when the company earned $ unk million on sales of $ 3.18 billion .
the independent telephone companies also may post third-quarter results that trail the comparable year-ago period . rochester telephone co. , for instance , said it expects third-quarter earnings to be `` somewhat lower '' than the year-earlier quarter -- even though the company expects to post an extraordinary gain of 50 cents during the period . the company said higher expenses and competitive pressures hampered earnings .
for the 1988 third quarter , rochester telephone reported a net income of $ 12.9 million , or $ 1.10 a share , on revenue of $ unk million .
the unk of war between warner communications inc. and sony corp. over movie producers peter guber and jon peters has exploded into a legal battle that could prove an embarrassing setback to sony 's plans to enter the u.s. movie business .
on friday , after two weeks of unk settlement talks , warner filed suit in los angeles superior court against sony and guber peters entertainment co. , charging sony with unk the two producers to breach a five-year contract with warner . the suit seeks $ 1 billion in damages and an injunction barring messrs. guber and peters from taking the top management posts at columbia pictures entertainment inc . as previously reported , sony has agreed to pay $ 3.4 billion to acquire columbia and separately has agreed to pay $ 200 million for guber peters entertainment to obtain the services of its two co-chief executives .
sony and guber peters promptly unk , charging warner with attempting to interfere in sony 's acquisition of the two companies and with unk unk that the guber peters agreement with warner prevents them from accepting the senior management posts at columbia .
at issue in the lawsuits is the contract signed last march by messrs. guber and peters that requires the two to make movies exclusively for warner for the next five years . sony and messrs. guber and peters maintain that the contract does n't prohibit taking an executive post at another studio . moreover , they unk , the producers have an oral unk with warner bros. studio executives that gives them the right to `` terminate the producer relationship in the event they were given and chose to accept the opportunity to become senior executives of a motion picture studio , '' according to their unk .
warner , for its part , maintains that the written agreement prevents messrs. guber and peters from doing anything else in the motion picture business . warner says in its suit that sony `` has unk and illegally sought to steal the services of guber and peters and unk warner as a major competitor of columbia . '' moreover , warner says , sony unk the producers with `` unprecedented financial rewards to breach their unk unk commitments to warner . '' warner also names in its suit the two producers , sony corp. of america vice chairman michael unk , and walter yetnikoff , head of sony 's cbs records unit .
sony responded in its unk by charging warner , its chief executive steven j. ross , and warner bros. unit chairman robert daly and president terry semel with unk on an unlawful scheme to interfere with and disrupt sony 's acquisitions . warner , which is in the process of being acquired by time warner inc. , is attempting to `` sabotage '' sony 's efforts as part of a `` plan and scheme to dominate and control the entertainment business , '' the unk from sony and guber peters adds .
warner also appears to be trying to unk sony by unk the japanese company 's u.s executives , messrs. unk and yetnikoff , of unk dealings . in its suit , warner says that mr. ross warned sony 's mr. unk on sept. 26 at a dinner in washington , `` with guber peters in mind '' that in the u.s. `` it is essential that corporations honor written contracts and do not induce breach of contracts by others . '' sony went ahead the next day anyway and executed its own five-year agreement with the producers and agreed to buy their company , the suit adds . moreover , the suit adds that sony initially said it would n't buy guber peters unless the warner contract was settled . on tuesday , although a settlement was n't reached , sony publicly announced it would acquire guber peters . `` sony has thus unk and unk , and over warner 's protests , unk guber and peters to unk their contract with warner , '' the suit says .
warner 's decision to file suit in the wake of its failure to reach a settlement with sony did n't surprise executives at rival studios , who say warner is only protecting its own interests . the outcome of the legal battle , they add , could unk unk relationships in hollywood , where the unk rule has often been that contracts were made to be broken .
in warner 's case , the studio obviously unk the relationship with guber peters as a crucial factor in warner 's recent success and a central part of its future plans . warner has relied heavily on the two to find and produce movies for the studio , including this summer 's hit `` batman . '' warner says in its suit that `` guber and peters claim to have generated over one-half billion dollars in profits for warner from combined projects , '' a claim warner does n't dispute . and warner says it is currently financing about 50 new projects being developed by the two producers .
under an earlier agreement with warner , the producers were allowed to make movies elsewhere . for example , they made the hit `` unk '' for mgm\/ua communications co . but when warner signed a new agreement with the two in march , the terms specifically prohibited them from serving as producers or executive producers of movies for any other studio .
sony and the guber peters executives say in their unk , however , that the new contract eliminated language barring the two from serving `` in any other capacity '' in the motion picture business . and they appear to be unk heavily on an alleged `` oral agreement '' the two producers claim to have with warner that would let them out of their written contract in the event that an actual executive post at another company became available . in their unk , they say that on two previous occasions -- once in 1987 when they considered a post at columbia , and once when messrs. guber and peters tried to buy a stake in mgm\/ua in 1988 -- warner was prepared to release them from their contract . the unk also charges warner with making the oral agreement to `` unk induce '' them into a new written contract in 1989 . moreover , they say , warner is trying to unk them out of `` a unique business opportunity '' and the unk of their `` long-term dream '' to run their own studio .
but entertainment industry executives say that the new contract was signed after guber peters efforts to take over mgm failed and that warner may argue in court that the producers ' willingness to sign a new long-term contract signaled the end of their search for a movie studio .
mr. ross and his team at warner appear to view the move by the two producers to sony as a personal unk after years of support and friendship . `` warner has been unk its relationship with guber and peters since 1972 , long before their recent success , '' the warner suit says . that success , the suit adds , `` is due in large measure to the trust and confidence that warner has unk in these producers , even in the early years of the relationship when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for warner . ''
warner , whose executives are the highest paid in the entertainment industry , also charges that sony unk the two producers to breach their warner contract by offering them `` the most lucrative and expensive package of financial unk in the film industry , '' including $ 2.7 million each in annual salary , deferred compensation of $ 50 million , as much as 10 % of columbia 's cash flow , and as much as 8 % of the future appreciation of columbia 's market value . the producers also stand to get more than $ 50 million from their combined 28 % stake in guber peters entertainment from sony 's $ 200 million offer for the company .
in their unk , messrs. guber and peters say they seek $ 100 million in damages initially from warner but may seek a higher amount later after determining the extent of damages .

advertising agencies ' third-quarter earnings are expected to be up modestly from a year ago , securities analysts say .
andrew unk , an analyst at drexel burnham lambert , is estimating interpublic group , for example , at 21 cents a share , up from 18 cents a share a year ago . unk unk , an analyst at goldman sachs , is unk unk group at 17 cents a share , up from 15 cents a share , and unk , unk & unk communications inc. at 55 cents a share , up from 46 cents .
analysts note , however , that the third period is a minor quarter in terms of unk profits . those who watch madison avenue say this period , along with the first quarter , is traditionally weak . the fourth quarter is where the real impact is made . `` we tend not to read much into third-quarter earnings , '' mr. unk says .
also notable is the fact that saatchi & saatchi co. and wpp group plc , two british giants that are principal players in the advertising business , do n't report quarterly earnings .
in the industry overall , `` profits will increase unless revenues are unk lower , '' said alan unk , an analyst at painewebber inc. , new york . `` there are no external indications '' to indicate that will be the case , he said . mr. unk noted that the employee count for the industry is down and that most agencies are watching unk levels in a bid to closely monitor costs .
others are cautiously watching the value of the dollar overseas . `` from where i sit , the biggest issue for the u.s. agencies is the dollar , '' said unk hill , an analyst at wertheim schroder & co. , new york . `` for the u.s. companies , the risk is one of disappointment unk unk because of the dollar . '' ad agencies rely heavily on business overseas for their bottom line . the strength of the dollar will hurt the reporting of foreign earnings , many analysts said .
some agencies , including interpublic group 's unk and saatchi & saatchi 's backer spielvogel bates , have said that their clients are spending less than they had expected . few agencies are reporting that their clients ' ad budgets are expanding .
all eyes , however , are on the fourth quarter and to reporting by the giant british companies . `` saatchi & saatchi is having a very tough year , '' drexel burnham 's mr. unk said . `` it 's real unk figuring out what they 'll earn . '' that agency , rumored as a takeover candidate , earlier this year said pretax profit for 1989 would trail 1988 's already disappointing level . for wpp group , on the other hand , most analysts are looking for margin improvement and good results considering its acquisition earlier this year of ogilvy group .
the involvement of units of two major u.s. banks in separate loans to china has signaled a growing willingness among foreign bankers to resume lending to the beijing government .
one of the units , unk asia ltd. , a subsidiary of bankers trust new york corp. , this week arranged the unk of a $ 50 million , five-year loan to unk ltd. , which is owned by china international trust & investment corp . ( holdings ) , or unk . the loan will be used for unk 's share of the purchase of a satellite , a unk asia director said .
the other unit , chase manhattan asia ltd. , a hong kong subsidiary of chase manhattan corp. , of new york , said it is underwriting a $ 50 million loan for china 's biggest trading company , china resources ( holdings ) co. , for general corporate purposes . of the total , $ 30 million can be unk into marks .
amid the international outcry following the unk of students and unk in beijing on june 4 , unk lending to china came to a halt .
bankers in hong kong said this week 's unk loan was an important sign that foreign banks are interested in unk regular business with china . `` it 's sort of a benchmark , '' said a u.s. banker who did n't participate in the loan .
russell l. unk , senior managing director of chase manhattan asia , said `` it is time '' to start considering loans to china again . mr. unk said chase hopes to unk an international group of banks in the lending syndicate , including some of u.s. and japanese banks with which china resources has had a strong relationship in recent years . `` right now we think we can successfully syndicate this loan because of china resources ' name , '' he said .
indeed , the unk of china resources and unk played a significant role in the decisions . china resources and unk are considered exceptionally good credit risks , bankers said . other loans to china will have to be considered on a unk basis . beyond the political considerations , banks are concerned about the state of china 's economy and about borrowers ' ability to make loan payments . now that the first major unk of a chinese loan has unk smoothly , a japanese banker said it will be easier for foreign banks to consider making loans to china .
unk , which acts as a sort of merchant bank for overseas acquisitions by china , is a relatively independent company . through unk , it is one of three partners in asia satellite telecommunications co. , which plans to launch a private satellite on a chinese unk next year . the other partners are cable & unk plc of britain and unk unk ltd. of hong kong . unk guaranteed the loan .
the loan was unk to a group of foreign banks from europe , hong kong and canada , foreign bankers said ; they did n't identify the institutions . unk asia arranged the unk but did n't underwrite the loan .
a unk asia official would n't disclose all the terms of the loan but said it was linked to a currency option that allows banks to receive repayment in yen instead of dollars . the official said unk will pay an interest rate that will be about 0.5 percentage point higher than the amount unk would have paid for a similar borrowing before june 4 . he said it was difficult to unk the exact interest rate because of the currency option .
bankers said they believe china resources ' loan costs have risen by about the same amount .
demand for products in the current quarter should weaken and inflation should n't put any upward pressure on prices , say u.s. plant managers in a dun & bradstreet corp. survey .
fewer plant managers expect higher new orders and output this quarter than in the year-earlier period , according to the survey , which polls 1,500 managers of manufacturing facilities on conditions in their factories and industries .
plant managers ' optimism `` has unk , which is in line with current economic data that indicate slow but continuing economic growth , '' said joseph w. unk , corporate economist and chief unk for dun & bradstreet , a unk company .
the managers expect materials costs to drop in the quarter , leading fewer to forecast higher selling prices , mr. unk said .
dun & bradstreet unk several optimism indexes , unk the percentage of managers expecting a decline from the percentage expecting growth .
for overall demand , the fourth-quarter index fell to 28 from 31 last quarter and 32 in the 1988 fourth period . for output , the index was 29 , the same as last quarter , but a unk drop from a year ago . for new orders , the figure again was flat with the third quarter at 29 . the latest figure also is down a point from the year earlier .
the u.s. dollar strengthened during the summer and may have unk the managers ' hopes for higher demand from overseas . recent `` declines in the dollar should bolster manufacturers ' selling opportunities abroad , '' mr. unk said .
for the next 12 months , each of the indexes for overall demand , production and new orders fell one point from last quarter , to 57 , 57 and 59 , respectively . the year-earlier figures were 60 , 60 and 61 .
dun & bradstreet 's data measuring fourth-quarter costs of making a single unit of a product indicated that `` manufacturers unk weaker prices '' for materials `` while wage pressures , though still present , are not expected to unk , '' mr. unk said .
bad real estate loans continued to unk at third-quarter profits of southwestern banks , with the notable exception of institutions that unk their books with federal unk .
`` you 've got a unk market , '' said frank w. anderson , an analyst with unk inc. , little rock , unk . on top , he said , are such unk as ncnb corp. and first city bancorp of texas , which acquired big , ailing texas banks in unk transactions that allowed them to unk off bad loans . they are expected to ring up big profits for the third quarter , mr. anderson said .
as for the rest , warns james unk , an analyst with unk unk & woods , new york , `` asset quality concerns are going to dominate third-quarter reports . ''
for example , unk bankers inc. , san antonio , texas , is expecting `` an uptick in { unk loans } related to real estate '' in the third quarter , said thomas unk , chairman and chief executive . as the only major bank holding company in texas to survive without a bailout or merger , unk managed only `` very modest '' earnings in the period , he said . `` if the government handed me a big unk of money i 'd look good , too , '' mr. unk added .
ncnb corp. 's texas operation , on the other hand , is expected to report an operating profit `` in line with { or } perhaps a bit better '' than its results in the first two quarters , timothy unk , vice chairman of the texas unit , said . the texas unit had an operating profit of $ unk million in the first quarter and $ unk million in the second quarter .
ncnb , based in charlotte , n.c. , bought the banking assets of failed first republic bank corp. of dallas last year in a transaction expected to cost the federal deposit insurance corp. about $ 3 billion . ( first republic is n't related to first republic bancorp of san francisco . ) robert unk , an analyst with unk pierce unk inc. , dallas , estimates unk first city 's third-quarter net was higher than second quarter earnings of $ unk million . however , he estimated that per-share earnings stayed `` relatively flat '' at about the second quarter 's $ 1.19 a share because the total number of shares outstanding increased .
first city was unk last year by a group led by chicago banker a. robert unk . the unk contributed nearly $ 1 billion to the new organization .
more recent texas unk wo n't have much impact on the third quarter results of the new parent companies , analysts said . these include the sale of unk 's failed banks to banc one corp. , columbus , ohio ; the sale of national unk corp. of texas to unk corp. of pittsburgh ; and the sale of texas american unk inc. 's banking assets to deposit guaranty bank of dallas . the transactions have n't yet been completed and the texas units are still unprofitable .
said ronald unk , chairman of deposit guaranty : `` you wo n't see the newly unk bank in operation until approximately dec. 1 . ''
outside texas , the biggest real estate nightmare for banks in the region is probably arizona . `` arizona is going to be a mess , '' said unk unk 's mr. unk .
several banks with operations in arizona , including first interstate unk and security pacific corp. , both of los angeles , have already indicated they see unk problems . chase manhattan corp. , new york , last month took a $ unk million charge against earnings related to real estate loans at chase bank of arizona .
several credit rating agencies recently downgraded the senior debt of valley national corp. , warning that the unk bank holding company is vulnerable to the deteriorating real estate market . `` despite the special addition to reserves in the second quarter , valley remains poorly reserved against its real estate exposure , '' moody 's investors service inc. said in july .
one of the few bright spots in the region is colorado , where a unk economic recovery has helped several banks unk the flow of red ink . for instance , united banks of colorado inc. , the state 's largest unk holding company , resumed a cash dividend earlier this year after recording eight straight quarters of profitability .
more good news comes from new mexico , where banks did n't have as much opportunity to get into difficulty in the first place . `` the state never grew fast enough to get banking organizations in real trouble and the banking organizations were never big enough to lend into trouble , '' said mr. unk of unk pierce unk .
we do n't know who is winning the drug war in latin america , but we know who 's losing it -- the press . over the past six months , six journalists have been killed and 10 unk by drug unk or leftist guerrillas -- who often are one and the same -- in colombia . over the past 12 years , at least 40 journalists have died there . the attacks have unk since the colombian government began unk down on the unk in august , trying to prevent their takeover of the country .
the unk in colombia was very much on the minds of 450 editors and publishers from latin america , the united states , the caribbean and canada attending the unk general assembly of the unk press association in unk , mexico , this week . on tuesday the conference got word of another unk , the assassination in unk of two employees of el espectador , colombia 's second-largest newspaper . the paper 's local administrator , maria unk unk , was shot dead , and her mother unk , while her car was stopped for a red light . an hour later , the paper 's circulation manager , unk unk , was shot and killed near his home .
the drug unk who claimed responsibility said they would blow up the unk newspaper 's offices if it continued to distribute in unk . they unk the unk offices last month , destroying its computer and causing $ 2.5 million in damage .
el espectador has been a special target because of the extraordinary unk of its publisher and his staff . at unk , publisher luis unk unk , although shaken by the unk , issued a statement saying : `` we will not cease our fight against drug trafficking . they want to unk the press and in particular el espectador because it has always been a unk in this war . '' this comes from a man whose brother , unk , was murdered in 1986 .
the publishers in unk command no unk , but they agreed to express their unk with unk in today 's editions . many will use a common editorial . a final statement yesterday said : `` while some advances are being made in nations throughout the unk , the state of press freedom in the unk still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the unk form of censorship : death by assassination . ''
the report charged that panama 's manuel noriega is not only in league with the drug unk but also is unk the press as never before . `` noriega has closed every independent newspaper , radio and television station and arrested , unk or forced into unk a long list of reporters , '' the statement declared .
it added : `` in cuba , public enemy no. 1 of press freedoms in the unk , repression of journalists both cuban and foreign is worse than ever . '' and in nicaragua , promises of press freedom by the sandinistas `` have not materialized . ''
as it happens , the four countries cited , colombia , cuba , panama and nicaragua , are not only where the press is under greatest attack but also are linked by the drug trade and unk politics . noriega is close to unk and may once have been his agent . sandinistas thomas unk and the ortega brothers are unk unk ; he backed their takeover of nicaragua . in colombia , the unk guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include unk , which unk has clearly backed .
robert unk , a former u.s. attorney handling drug unk in florida , does n't think for a minute that unk 's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the unk drug unk . `` if the unk succeeds in unk the colombian authorities into negotiations , the unk will be in control and unk can exploit his past relationships with them , '' he told the journal 's david unk recently .
the struggle against the drug unk in colombia will be a near thing . this week , the government arrested jose unk unk , said to be the unk unk leader . he will probably be unk to the u.s. for trial under an unk treaty president unk unk has revived . later , another unk unk , unk vargas , was arrested and 1,000 pounds of unk seized . mr. unk has refused u.s. troops or advisers but has accepted u.s. military aid .
president bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with mr. unk , president alan garcia of peru and president unk unk unk of unk to discuss the drug problem . it might not be a bad idea to do that sooner , rather than later . after the panama unk , they will need some unk . certainly , the colombian press is much in need of that .
great american communications co. , cincinnati , said it exchanged about $ 50 million in debentures and notes for unk million of its common shares at $ 12 a share . as a result of the transaction , american financial corp. 's common holdings in great american declined to 64 % from 71 % . the broadcasting concern said the debt retired unk of $ 35 million of 14 3\/8 % senior subordinated debentures , $ unk million of 13 1\/4 % senior notes and $ 200,000 of 14 1\/8 % senior notes of a subsidiary . american financial is a financial holding company .
robert l. unk jr. , 45 years old , was named managing director and regional manager of japan and asia at this firm 's chemical bank unit . the post was occupied on an interim basis by unk morrison , a managing director in the unk and unk department in tokyo . mr. unk most recently was head of administration and portfolio management at the chemical realty group division of chemical bank .
unk communications s.a. , a unit of france 's defense and electronics group , unk s.a. , said it expects strong profit growth in both 1989 and 1990 .
the company , which is preparing to sell 10 % of its shares on the french stock market , said profit could reach between 100 million francs ( $ unk million ) and 110 million francs this year , representing increases of between 30 % and 44 % from the 1988 level of unk million francs .

the company plans to raise 1.5 billion francs with its share offer , involving the sale of one million shares . between 1 % and 2 % of the offering has been set aside for the company 's employees . the offering will begin oct. unk en
walker telecommunications corp. said it plans to repurchase as many as one million shares from time to time , depending on the state of the market .

unk unk would appear to be a marketer 's dream come true . the corporate manager likes to dress unk , both on and off the job . she owns a unk in chicago and takes pride in unk it well .
yet ms. unk , in her unk , unk shopping . unk service and poor selections at many stores have turned a once favorite unk into what she calls a `` unk '' experience . these days , she would rather exercise , visit friends or read . `` if you do n't make it reasonably easy for me , '' she says of shopping , `` i 'm not going to waste my time . ''
ms. unk is far from alone . shopping has become such a unk that more people hate unk in stores than hate doing household work , according to the wall street journal 's `` american way of buying '' survey . nearly a third of the unk people interviewed by the unk peter d. hart research associates said they `` do not enjoy at all '' unk or unk . unk , unk , unk , a market research firm in unk , conn. , warns clients that americans ' love affair with shopping is on the rocks : more than half the women it has surveyed in recent years , and an even larger percentage of men , say shopping for clothes is a unk .
unk consumers -- unk jobs , families and leisure activities -- feel they have less time to shop . they also complain about unk and poorly trained salespeople , lower quality merchandise and unk prices .
but underlying these complaints is a more far-reaching change : for many shoppers , the unk is gone .
back in the 1970s , when unk were unk across the country , consumers were content to unk away an afternoon and buy whatever struck their fancy . then in the early 1980s , americans viewed shopping as a unk for the unk merchandise or the best bargains they could unk about to their friends .
now , on the unk of the 1990s , consumer researchers say that for most people , shopping is simply less fun . retailers unk unk merchandise in stores that are unk similar in appearance . shopping has become `` just one of the activities that we have to do , '' says susan unk of unk . `` it 's not an end in itself anymore . ''
in the journal poll , more than a third of the people interviewed said they probably would n't spend a free hour unk around in stores , even if a prime shopping district were nearby .
that is n't to say consumers do n't like new things . but when they go to a store today , they 're more likely to think of the trip as a mission rather than an unk . `` they 're buyers as opposed to shoppers , '' says thomas unk , a retail consultant at the accounting firm of ernst & young .
surveys and unk research show that most people are indeed shopping more unk . consumers visit fewer stores per trip ( an average of three last year , down from 3.6 in 1982 , according to consultant unk jones & co . ) and spend less time in unk ( an average of 68 minutes per trip last year , down from 90 minutes in 1982 ) . `` i leave rather than hunt for something , '' unk unk max , a unk real estate broker in new york .
despite such negative attitudes , retailers generally say consumers are n't cutting back on what they buy . `` if it is dropping off , it would be more likely that they 're shopping less often and buying more when they do shop , '' says michael unk , vice president of marketing at k mart corp .
`` there 's no question our customers ' time has become more valuable than ever , '' says stephen watson , chairman and chief executive officer of dayton hudson corp. 's department store unit . but he contends the company 's record sales and profits indicate it is making the shopping experience easier . for example , the company is hiring more sales people than in the past and paying them more . it also is laying out unk and new stores with a unk design and unk unk and elevators in more convenient central locations .
of course , there are still people for whom shopping is a unk , even a passion . but some of those people have complaints , too . take unk unk , a mother of two from norwood , mass . she often enjoys shopping , but is so fed up with the unk at a nearby unk 's department store that she unk to them as `` unk . ''
twice , mrs. unk picked merchandise off unk 's unk labeled with `` sale '' signs , only to be told when she got to the cash register that the goods were n't on special . the second time , she demanded that she receive the discount anyway , and the clerk gave in . `` i 'm willing to spend a lot of money , '' she says , `` but not if i feel like i 'm getting unk around . ''
complaints about service are so widespread that six of 10 people in the journal survey said they have unk stores because of the way they were treated . the percentage was even higher -- roughly unk -- among professionals and those earning more than $ 50,000 a year .
service has declined just at a time when consumers are more unk than ever . `` the whole tone of voice is different now in terms of what people expect from a store , '' says william unk , whose columbus , ohio , management consulting firm has surveyed consumers for more than 20 years .
despite the rising unk , few stores are making shopping more appealing . sales people unk unk still assault shoppers at many department stores , even though some consumers complain that the unk could provide a far more useful service if they were trained to operate a cash register .
consumers want selection to be easy and efficient , but that 's not what most unk want . retailers generally go to unk to keep shoppers in their stores as long as possible . many stores , for example , require customers to walk through a unk of unk designed to show off their unk just to find , say , a simple white unk . but rather than unk people to buy more , consumer researchers say , this unk just unk many shoppers . over half the respondents in the journal survey said they rarely buy on unk anyway .
so what should a retailer do ? `` those that do the best job of making the shopping experience unk and making the customer feel like a human being are very well unk , '' says leo j. shapiro , a market researcher in chicago .
he cites unk inc. , the unk department store . the chain 's strategy : pay sales people an incentive to provide good service and keep more merchandise in stock than competitors .
other retailers are trying to unk unk shoppers by doing away with their unk practice of setting high `` regular '' prices that can later be cut to `` sale '' levels . under a new approach being unk as `` everyday low pricing , '' retailers such as sears , roebuck & co. now run fewer sales . instead , they set prices between their old `` sale '' and `` regular '' prices .
last month , unk macy & co. started promising in ads that shoppers in search of women 's coats could `` cut through all the confusing sales , special buys and unk out there '' and pay what macy 's says is the `` lowest prices ... every day . ''
sears started its `` everyday pricing '' approach in march , but so far sales results do n't reflect strong consumer response .
still , such a pricing strategy just might appeal to people like unk bates , a unk in the journal survey . she recently walked out of a furniture store because the salesman offered to cut the price of a unk unk three times . when a store keeps dropping prices , the unk , mich. , resident says , `` i get unk that they 're trying to get the most they can out of you . ''

the european community and switzerland signed a treaty granting unk access to their markets for most kinds of insurance products and services .
the accord is an example `` of the kind of relations the community wishes to develop with its european partners , '' said unk unk , the french minister for european affairs who unk over a recent ec council of ministers meeting .
as european partners , mrs. unk cited in particular the members of the european free trade association , composed of switzerland , unk , sweden , norway , finland and unk .
ec and association ministers are scheduled to meet dec. 19 to discuss economic cooperation . mrs. unk said she hopes the talks will show `` a common resolve to go beyond unk , unk agreements , '' such as the one just signed with switzerland .
swiss president unk unk said the insurance pact could `` pioneer '' a broader agreement between the community and the association .
the treaty allows swiss insurance companies to open branches in the ec , and vice unk , without restriction . but it does n't permit selling insurance across borders without establishing branches . the treaty needs to be approved by the european parliament , which is expected to unk the measure , ec officials said .
the agreement , which had been 16 years in the making , covers unk services and unk life insurance and reinsurance . because swiss and ec insurers are widely present on each other 's markets , the accord is n't expected to substantially increase near-term competition .
an important element in the accord , ec officials said , is a clause that provides for unk unk when one party decides to modify its internal insurance legislation . a joint panel would decide whether the changes are compatible with the treaty or whether the treaty needs to be amended to cope with the changes .
mrs. unk said a similar clause could be useful in future accords between the ec and other countries .
chief executive officers in the new york region say they share a national unk about the economy , yet are bullish on their own prospects , according to a study of business executives .
one particularly positive note in the study of chief executives in the unk area , commissioned by national unk bancorp , is that as many as 88 % of the executives intend to expand their businesses or at least maintain employment levels in 1990 . employment at unk companies in the new york area were hit hard after the 1987 stock market crash .
the survey unk the opinions of 550 unk selected companies in the new york metropolitan area -- connecticut , long island , new york city , unk county and new jersey -- with annual sales between $ 5 million and $ 250 million .
executives in the area have grown more pessimistic about the performance of the national economy . when the study was taken in 1988 , 32 % of the respondents thought the national economy was worse that year than the year before , while in 1989 , that stance was taken by 41 % of the executives . the unk was greater among the larger -- and more national -- companies .
looking ahead , the majority of area officials expect interest rates to decline and inflation to rise , while 44 % of the chief executives feel a recession is likely by the end of
on the regional level , executives had less good news to report about their own businesses . only 49 % of the executives reported improved company performance this year , down from the 60 % in the 1988 study . predictably , the year ahead looks unk ; 63 % of the executives anticipate better company performance in 1990 , while only 10 % unk a decline .
a good sign for the long-term health of the region is that chief executives were generally `` quite satisfied '' with the region as a business place , saying its benefits consistently outweigh unk . highest marks went to the availability of professional business services , which 51 % of the executives consider the top benefit . the local marketplace and availability of professional employees also were ranked high . among major unk to the region , 63 % consider the level of state taxes at the top of the list , followed by 54 % who had the same opinion on local taxes . coming in third , 40 % said it was the cost of unk employees .
on questions of employment , 40 % of the executives increased their work force since last year , and 44 % expect to expand next year . only 9 % reduced their unk in the past year .
for the second year in a row , new jersey was rated as the region 's most desirable place to do business . among all of the executives surveyed who would consider a move , 50 % would look at new jersey , compared with an average 23 % who would consider other states in the region . in one of the highest degrees of loyalty shown in the study , of those new jersey executives considering a move , 74 % would stay within the state . but unk of the state 's executives listed transportation problems as a unk .
chief executives in new york city showed a unk high expectation of improved company performance in the next year . in new york , 75 % of the executives predict their companies ' performance will improve in 1990 , compared with an average of 63 % from chief executives from the other unk who feel the same way .
unk executives reflected the most bullish prospects for employment . more companies in unk than any other location have increased the number of their employees in the past year . in 1990 , unk chief executives lead the way in plans to increase their number of employees . in unk , 51 % of the executives anticipate hiring more , while in long island that number was 39 % and in connecticut 42 % .
ronald j. unk was elected to the new post of senior vice unk apparel group , effective nov. 1 . he will be responsible for the apparel operations of the retailer 's unk 's little folk shop inc. and unk brothers co. units and the susie 's division of its unk unk corp. unit . mr. unk , 50 years old , currently is president and chief executive officer of the little folk unit .
unk motor co. 's u.s. sales arm has named gary anderson its top u.s. official in the wake of a series of resignations last month .
three senior executives , all americans , quit in september . unk unk , former vice president and general manager and at the time the top american , said in a prepared statement that his and the other resignations were prompted by `` changes in the company 's operating goals and unk . ''
mr. anderson , who joined american unk motor corp. in june 1987 , gets the title of marketing director for the company 's automotive division . he unk `` unk of several positions , '' said a unk spokeswoman , who added that a reorganization last month has eliminated some previous posts .
in his new job , mr. anderson will oversee all sales , advertising and dealer development activities in addition to unk marketing strategies . some of these duties had been handled by mr. unk and others by john unk , former director of sales , and larry unk , former national sales manager . messrs. unk and unk were the other two executives who resigned in september .
unk sales so far this year , at unk cars and sport utility vehicles , are less than half the level of a year ago , despite the introduction of two additional vehicles , including unk 's first u.s. car . the company has n't recovered from claims by consumer reports magazine that its unk utility vehicle was unk , even though the national highway traffic safety administration refused to open a safety investigation into the allegations .
`` unk recognizes its responsibility to boost dealer confidence and improve direct communication with its dealers and field personnel on its plans and strategies , '' said mr. anderson in a prepared statement .
mr. anderson was most recently unk 's new york regional sales manager . he also served as manager of dealer development .
unk engine co. shares dropped yesterday after the company disclosed it will have to correct defects in unk installed in some of its engines .
in a unk release , the maker of unk engines , parts and power systems said it has `` identified a problem '' with unk used in its model k and unk unk since may 1 . the unk motors are used in heavy applications such as construction and mining equipment .
unk said the problem unk to recent modifications in the design of a unk it buys from an outside supplier . none of the engines have failed to date , said a spokeswoman , adding that the unk does n't represent a unk .
the company would n't identify the supplier , nor would it say how many of the defective engines it has produced . a spokeswoman noted , however , that such engines represented only 2.5 % of the company 's overall production in the first six months of the year .
the company said it will replace all unk in the affected engines , and as a result , will `` supplement k and unk warranty unk . '' the spokeswoman declined to say how much money the company will have to spend on the repairs ; the company recently halted production of the models until replacement unk are available oct. 16 .
in composite new york stock exchange trading yesterday , unk shares unk $ 2 to close at $ 52 . the company 's shares traded as high as $ 64 last month , before unk disclosed in late september that it expects to report a `` substantial '' third-quarter loss because of deteriorating demand and other difficulties .
major steel companies , stung by soft demand from car makers and unk prices , are expected to report that third-quarter operating profits plummeted to possibly the lowest levels in two years .
`` this will be the worst quarter since the third quarter of 1987 , when steel companies were just on their way up , '' predicted john unk , an analyst with donaldson , lufkin & jenrette securities corp . the fourth quarter could be even more dismal .
`` we are in the midst of a very severe price drop that will really hit in the fourth quarter , '' said peter unk , an analyst with painewebber inc . a rebound in those prices is expected sometime after the winter of 1990 .
after enjoying a unk unk of full production , rising prices and lower costs , steelmakers are facing declining volume from disappointing automotive , unk and even capital goods markets .
the consensus is that major steelmakers earned between $ 30 and $ 35 for each ton of steel shipped , compared with $ 49 in last year 's third quarter . the latest quarter is also down from the $ 51 a ton earned in the second quarter , when the industry benefited from modest price increases and lower raw material costs . mr. unk expects fourth-quarter profits to drop to about $ 25 a ton .
along with lackluster sales to car makers -- their largest customer -- steelmakers are losing shipments to their second largest customer , steel service centers , which are trying to reduce inventories . the steel service center institute reported in september that 72 % of its members believe inventories were `` too high , '' with 65 % planning to reduce those levels during the next six months .
christopher unk , an analyst with unk group , noted that the capital goods market , which had been stronger than automotive and unk markets , is showing signs of weakness as well . companies , concerned about the economy and trying to slash their own costs , are backing off capital improvement programs , he said .
overall , unk steel shipments are expected to drop about 15 % to 36 million or 37 million tons , which some analysts say could cost the industry $ 700 million in lost income .
two companies , in particular , were hurt by unusual events in the third quarter . bethlehem steel corp. , the nation 's second largest steelmaker , was hampered by unk coal strikes , a spot strike at its freight car operation and blast unk problems at its crown unk unk point plant . charles bradford , an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets , predicts bethlehem earnings dropped more than two-thirds to about 50 cents a share , from $ unk a year ago , excluding major nonrecurring items .
national steel corp. , the nation 's sixth largest steel company , predicted at the beginning of 1989 that the third quarter would be its best . however , an initial rejection by steelworkers of a new labor accord sent nervous national steel customers scrambling for alternative suppliers . moreover , national steel is tied closely to the sluggish automobile industry .
one other factor for some steelmakers : higher costs associated with new labor contracts . inland steel industries inc. , which recently negotiated an accord that calls for immediate and significant wage increases , is expected to see earnings drop to less than $ 1 a share from $ unk a year earlier because of the pact , as well as disappointments in its steel service center operations .
about the only major steelmaker expected to post improved results is usx corp. , which once again will post gains from asset sales . many analysts initially raised earnings forecasts for the nation 's largest steelmaker as a result of the coming sale of reserves from its texas oil & gas unit . the expected $ 1 unk proceeds are expected to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares . one wild card in usx 's future earnings is investor carl icahn , who boosted his stake in usx and is urging more restructuring .
recent order rates indicate that the fourth quarter , a time shipments usually pick up , will be weak as well . merrill lynch 's mr. bradford said , `` we have n't seen the pickup in flat rolled orders that we should have . '' flat rolled steel is the industry 's major product .
typically , steelmakers would look to the export market to unk excess capacity . but that market is hurting as well . painewebber noted that the world steel export price of unk steel has dropped to $ unk to $ unk a metric ton from a high of $ unk this spring . moreover , the relative strength of the dollar and lower world prices may result in increased sales in the u.s. by foreign producers offering lower prices .
there are some bright spots for the industry . the service center association reports that shipments were up in august , indicating a unk in demand for carbon flat rolled and unk steel products . john jacobson , an analyst with unk consultants , also said he believes steel production costs are coming down because of increased unk at major mills .

unk unk corp. said it expects to report that third-quarter operating profit fell `` substantially '' from a year earlier , when the maker of unk , unk and plastic materials had profit before extraordinary items of $ 1.36 a share .
in a prepared statement , the company said the decline `` reflects reduced activity in construction , marine and transportation markets . ''
an unk spokesman said the company still expects to post net income for the unk third quarter but he declined to be more specific . he also declined to comment on expectations for the fourth quarter .
unk closed at $ unk a share , down $ unk , in new york stock exchange composite trading following the news .
in the 1988 third quarter , unk had profit from continuing operations of $ 57 million . a charge of $ 6 million , or 15 cents a share , related to the purchase of company debt made net $ 51 million , or $ unk a share . sales in the 1988 third quarter totaled $ unk million .
the spokesman said the problems in the construction market unk mainly to `` reduced volume in unk and unk , especially unk and commercial unk products . '' he said unk repairs were relatively strong in texas and should be strong in the southeast during the fourth quarter as home and building owners repair property damaged by hurricane hugo . `` but nationally , based on trends so far this year , we expect { that segment } to remain weak over all , '' he said .
the spokesman said sales of unk material to the unk industry also were weak , largely because of softening in the marine market . weakness in the auto industry also is expected to continue through the rest of the year . car and truck production was strong earlier this year , but expectations of slower sales in the fourth quarter have cut manufacturers ' output forecasts . however , unk was able to offset that decline somewhat with new business at general motors corp. , which recently introduced a new , unk van .
unk expects to post third-quarter results by the end of next week , the spokesman said .

as india unk up for general elections to be held by january , television is emerging as a powerful political tool -- and a highly controversial one .
television is unk into 74 % of the country 's unk , up from 49 % during the 1984 unk campaign . the government hopes to get unk into all of india 's unk unk eventually .
but the government is essentially the only unk . it controls the sole national tv network , unk , and the only national radio system , all india radio . tv news coverage has generally favored the government .
in recent months , however , critics say the coverage has been so unk toward prime minister unk gandhi and his ruling congress ( i ) party that what is labeled news is merely propaganda . with the elections approaching , critics say the manipulation of such an influential medium unk a threat to india 's democratic unk .
`` in a country with our measure of unk , television is becoming a serious unk in the way of free and fair elections , '' says unk unk unk , an unk leader and a former minister of information and broadcasting . `` it unk the balance totally in favor of the ruling party . ''
but unk unk unk , minister for information and broadcasting , says : `` we are the elected representatives of the people , and we will do whatever we think is fit and in the interests of the people . ''
there is general agreement on one point : the elections are likely to be the most uncertain since 1967 . many say mr. gandhi and congress ( i ) , with unk popularity and an arms scandal that has unk the government , stand a chance of losing power . the arms scandal involves a report by india 's comptroller and unk general , which cited unk in the government 's evaluation and purchase of unk guns from a swedish arms company .
television came to india in 1965 , when unk unk began in new unk . unk to other cities did n't start until 1972 , and color unk unk just seven years ago .
in 1980 , the country had 1.6 million tv sets ; today there are 20 million . that 's a small number for a nation of 800 million people , but a single set might have much of a village for its audience . a sizable portion of unk indians now rely on television for news they used to hear third or fourth hand , if at all .
unk is controlled by the ministry of information and broadcasting and often takes orders directly from the prime minister 's office , some unk staff members contend .
according to critics , the shift in unk 's news coverage from generally unk the government to outright bias began in may . from around that time , the critics say , items on mr. gandhi and congress ( i ) have increasingly dominated the nationwide evening news and have been unk positive , while the opposition has been given short unk or unk abused .
in may , a unk news unk quoted unk from a newspaper article by an opposition leader . the article criticized both the government and the opposition , but unk aired only the parts unk the opposition . this was merely news judgment , says mr. unk , the information and broadcasting minister .
in the same month , a group of politicians circulated a photo of a top opposition leader , unk unk , unk with an alleged drug unk . newspapers carried the photo on their front pages . unk showed it on the nationwide news broadcast . the next day , a different group of politicians produced a photo of mr. gandhi standing next to the same alleged drug unk . newspapers again gave it unk play . unk ignored it . mr. unk says the prime minister is unk with many people and that therefore the photograph was n't news .
but a senior reporter at all india radio , who declines to be identified , says : `` we get orders from a chain of people . we are a government news agency and are expected to project the government . ''
for all the criticism of what is seen as government propaganda , many media experts say it could be unk . says unk unk unk , one of the unk of indian broadcasting and a former unk of all india radio and unk : `` it is unk whether this propaganda will bring votes to the government . by and large , people think that it will turn the people away .

troubled british defense contractor unk international signal plc replaced the head of its unk u.s. division .
unk said joseph unk , 49 years old , chairman of unk international usa , is `` unk '' his post . succeeding him as chairman of the large , unk , unk unit , is a longtime unk executive , albert unk . mr. unk , a unk unk , is a unk board member and managing director of unk 's unk division .
the u.s. unit is at the center of what unk has called a `` serious fraud '' that has unk the british company for the past month . unk acquired the u.s. business last year , in a merger with the then international signal & control group
an international signal unit , according to unk , reported on its books # unk million ( $ unk million ) of weapons contracts that did n't exist . the unk figures inflated international signal 's reported assets , and increased the price unk paid when it bought the company , according to unk officials .
mr. unk 's departure is the latest fallout from the scandal . unk has said it expects an accounting correction that would eliminate nearly half its reported net worth , and it 's seeking a buyer to repair its finances .
british aerospace plc and france 's thomson-csf s.a. are leading unk for a joint unk bid . yesterday , a london brokerage firm , unk unk ltd. , confirmed that it purchased on wednesday 5.7 million unk shares at 56 pence ( 87 cents ) apiece on behalf of british aerospace . the purchase boosts the british unk stake to unk million shares , or 1.7 % of the stock outstanding .
a unk spokesman declined to comment on whether the management unk is related to the financial scandal , but called it generally part of the `` integration '' of international signal into unk since the 1988 merger . he said mr. unk remains a unk director , but will also be succeeded by mr. unk as chief executive of unk unk .
mr. unk , through a spokesman in unk , declined to comment . the executive was a unk since 1980 of international signal founder james unk , who left international signal and unk last spring .
roy s. unk jr. , founder of unk co. , a construction and unk concern , was named a director of this bank holding company , expanding the board to seven members .
the dollar drifted lower in unk trading , its strength unk by concern that the federal reserve is unk easing monetary policy .
despite unk operations by the fed yesterday and on the three preceding business days , some analysts say the central bank is unk unk credit .
they say the fed 's unk operations have been necessary to address a seasonal unk of reserves , but note that the actions have n't been tough enough to prevent the federal funds rate from easing to about 8 3\/4 % from its recent level of 9 % . the federal funds rate is the overnight rate banks charge each other .
`` they 're unk in a consistently less aggressive manner and at a lower level , '' said james t. unk , a senior vice president at greenwich capital markets .
but others analysts say opinion unk unk on whether the fed is softening its credit stance , noting that the market 's unk reaction reflects this division .
`` we just do n't know enough yet to definitively say that the fed has eased ... the fed funds rate still is in a band around 9 % , '' said one economist .
speculation that the fed would sharply ease its credit unk was unk earlier this week when chairman alan greenspan said central banks should n't focus too much on intermediate goals for exchange rates and interest rates .
in late new york trading thursday , the dollar was quoted at unk marks , down from unk marks late wednesday , and at unk yen , down from unk yen late wednesday . sterling was quoted at $ unk , up from $ unk .
in tokyo friday , the u.s. currency opened for trading at unk yen , down from thursday 's tokyo close of unk yen .
many foreign exchange traders remain skeptical that a unk is in the unk . they plan to look for clues in two economic indicators due out today , one on the unk index and the other on retail sales , both for september .
`` the market believes unk will confirm greenspan 's concern about inflation , '' said unk unk , a vice president with credit suisse in new york . she said the market has already reacted to `` that particular prompting '' and is unlikely to bid the dollar significantly higher .
higher energy and auto prices are expected to have pushed producer prices up 0.3 % in september after declining in august and july . retail sales are expected to have remained flat in september , according to economists , following gains of 0.7 % in august and 0.5 % in july .
a long-awaited speech by british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson failed to bolster the unk pound and left many market participants with a unk bearish view of sterling .
unk to continue his government 's strategy of unk inflation with high interest rates , mr. lawson told the conservative party conference that the battle to rein in inflation required a strong currency . the unk are `` not the party of devaluation , '' he said .
but mr. lawson failed to unk specific policy changes or say how the british government planned to support the beleaguered pound . he also avoided any mention of when london would bring sterling into the exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system , and warned there are `` no easy answers '' to britain 's economic problems .
some market analysts see early entry into the ems exchange rate mechanism as one of the few alternatives left for stabilizing the pound . but entry has been opposed by prime minister thatcher , who insists britain should join from a position of strength .
wednesday 's discount rate increase in japan continued to dominate trading in tokyo , with dealers trying to guess what the bank of japan and the fed will do following the failure of the rate boost to unk the dollar .
the bank of japan entered the market several times in the morning to sell dollars for yen , traders said . european dealings were dominated by cross activity , unk by sterling .

tokyo stocks fell sharply as the dollar remained strong despite wednesday 's unk discount rate increase by the bank of japan .
london shares recovered some lost ground , largely on technical factors as chancellor nigel lawson 's speech to the conservative party conference was viewed as basically unk for the market .
tokyo 's nikkei index of 225 issues , which fell unk points wednesday , closed at unk , down unk . the decline of nearly 1.3 % left the index below unk for the first time since sept. 25 .
in the first hour of trading in tokyo friday , the nikkei index rose unk points to unk .
thursday 's volume on the first section was estimated at 650 million shares , compared with unk million wednesday . declining issues unk advancers unk , with 110 unchanged . the tokyo stock price index of all issues in the first section , which lost unk wednesday , was down unk , or 1.4 % , to unk .
the market opened at what proved to be its high and continued to slip toward the end of the day . traders said the reason its drop was larger than wednesday 's moderate loss was that investors began selling their holdings when they saw that wednesday 's rise to 3.75 % in the discount rate -- the central bank 's base rate on loans to commercial banks -- failed to curb the dollar 's rise against the yen .
a stronger dollar concerns japanese stock investors because it unk to japanese inflation , particularly by raising oil and other energy and natural resource prices , which are unk in dollars . in addition , higher prices for imports allow domestic manufacturers to increase their own prices .
moreover , the current high level of the u.s. stock market , and the possibility of u.s. interest rates being cut or japanese rates being raised again to keep the dollar down , might draw funds currently invested in japanese equities into the u.s. market , some investors fear .
unk unk , senior trader at unk phillips & drew international , said expectations of another increase in the discount rate already are causing some investors not only to stop buying but also to dump some of their recently acquired shares .
unk unk , manager of the investment information department at daiwa investment trust & management co. , said the market had been sustained recently by smaller issues with relatively low price-earnings ratios . prices of such shares , he said , now have risen an average of 57 % in the past six months , making them less attractive for fresh buying .
unk unk , director of the fund management department at unk investment trust management co. , said the discount rate increase did n't have much effect on the actual market environment , as short-term interest rates already had been above 5 % . and as the rate on newly issued three-month certificates of deposit went up to 6.2 % wednesday , institutions and corporations had little incentive to invest new funds in stocks .
the higher discount rate unk institutions from holding steel and construction shares , traders said . nippon steel fell 10 to unk yen ( $ unk ) a share , unk metal lost 19 to unk , and unk steel was down 9 at unk . unk was down 100 at unk , while unk lost 60 to 1,500 .

chancellor lawson , who has been under political fire for his decision a week ago to force u.k. banks ' base lending rates up to 15 % , an unk high , addressed the governing conservatives ' annual conference on current economic issues , and dealers said the speech was exactly what the market had expected .
`` it was a good party political conference speech , '' a dealer with a large u.k. unk operation said . `` he did n't calm any fears or unk , but at least he did n't create any new ones . ''
dealers attributed the day 's advances largely to a technical rebound from the sharp declines that followed last week 's unk increase . they also cited unk by market-makers seeking to generate some business and a general absence of active selling .
there was also some speculative energy that helped to support the ft-se 100 later in the session , when wall street showed signs of weakness early in its trading day . that energy came in part from renewed rumors that u.s. takeover specialists kohlberg kravis roberts are preparing to make a takeover bid for industrial concern unk rather than simply take a 15 % stake in it . dealers also pointed to active options dealing in the stock recently and said some of the options had been exercised . unk ended 7 higher at unk pence ( $ unk ) a share .
unk international signal rose 1 1\/2 to 58 on 8.5 million shares . british aerospace said earlier in the week that it was considering making a joint bid with france 's thomson-csf for unk .

other companies in the food sector also firmed on active volume , with unk group gaining 8 to unk , unk up 1\/2 to unk 1\/2 and j. unk advancing 3 to unk .
blue-chip issues attracted institutions looking for defensive positions amid the current doubts about the future of the u.k. economy , dealers said .
british steel edged 2 higher to unk 1\/2 on 8.3 million shares , british unk settled 6 higher at unk , and british petroleum gained 1 to unk 1\/2 .

the nation 's biggest beverage companies are expected to report stronger third-quarter earnings , even as the soft-drink giants take their unk from higher domestic soda prices and unk ' struggle with flat industry volume .
coca-cola co. , the first of the group to report , said yesterday that earnings rose 10 % , excluding a gain from the sale of a bottled water business . pepsico inc. and anheuser-busch cos. will report third-quarter earnings gains of at least 9 % and 14 % , respectively , while results for coca-cola enterprises inc. and unk coors co. will decline , analysts estimate .
since the summer , soft-drink companies have been trying to unk themselves from a unk war designed to steal market share from each other . the battle drove up volumes for several years , but the discounted prices have squeezed unk ' profit margins . because raw material costs have been unk and because coke and unk have become bigger owners of bottling businesses , the companies have been raising soda pop prices in recent months .
that , along with generally unk , unk weather this year , has slowed the industry 's volume growth . unlike the 4 % to 5 % growth rate of recent years , the soft-drink industry is expected to report third-quarter volume was , at worst , flat , and at best , up only 3 % . that 's a fairly wide range , given the sheer size of the $ 42 billion soft-drink industry .
but analysts , and indeed , some of the soda companies , have had difficulty predicting consumer reaction to higher prices . in august , coca-cola enterprises , coke 's largest bottling operation , said its 1989 earnings would fall as much as 37 % , partly because it unk consumer resistance to the new prices , which were 2 % to 3 % higher on average in july and august . unk higher prices in part , coca-cola said its third-quarter unit case sales were flat .
the volume in the summer selling season suffered , too , from the lack of a critical , yet unk , element in the unk industry : excitement . after a controversial unk involving a unk music video , unk dropped its plans for a big summer advertising promotion featuring the pop singer . and there have been no major new product unk , such as unk soft drinks , which made sales unk two years ago .
`` what 's been hot in the soft-drink business lately ? '' asks unk goldman , an analyst with painewebber inc . `` nothing . ''
still , the beverage industry 's slower results in the latest quarter could lead to some positive earnings surprises in next year 's third quarter , when comparisons will be easier , said george thompson , an analyst with prudential-bache securities inc . `` this year 's unk unk will be next year 's unk , '' he said .
coca-cola 's earnings were stronger primarily because of sharply improved volume from the company 's international operations , which account for the bulk of its business . volume rose 14 % , well ahead of analysts ' 10 % to 11 % projections for the business .
analysts are looking for unk to earn as much as $ 1.04 a share , with most estimates settling around 99 cents , compared with 91 cents in the year-ago quarter . the latest quarter results , are expected to be a little soft compared with unk 's historical earnings growth rate , reflecting some unk for unk and soft-drink bottling acquisitions . stronger restaurant and unk sales helped boost unk 's profits , too , analysts said .
anheuser-busch is expected to report third-quarter earnings between 89 cents and 92 cents a share , compared with 78 cents a year earlier . on the strength of unk light , unk and unk dry , the company 's volume in the quarter is estimated to increase about 3 % to 4 % , while the rest of the industry will be flat , or up slightly . coors earnings are expected to fall , as its volume declines perhaps 3 % to 4 % . coors is expected to achieve greater production unk once it unk its plan , announced last month , to acquire most of the unk assets of unk brewery co .
`` time , '' says unk unk , `` is unk . my youth in unk , my father -- whom i never saw again after unk , when i left russia for the west -- the whole of my early life , it 's all been brought back to me by the unk , out of a clear blue sky , of this exhibition . the years between unk and new york are the dream . the unk i grew up with , the things i thought i had said unk to forever -- that is the reality . ''
the reality to which ms. unk unk is the unk of dance unk currently on view at eduard unk fine arts here , under the title , `` 100 years of russian unk : unk . '' consisting of roughly 400 items from the unk state museum of theater and music , the show offers unk unk of a rich artistic achievement .
for ms. unk , an actress and author who began her career as a unk during the early days of the soviet state under her original name of unk , it offers something more : a sense of completion , the unk of a unk on the past . a great deal of what is currently on display in new york unk to her father . these unk , designs , programs , photographs , which she unk over day after day , fed her unk unk to join the unk . of this unk her father unk , because , he said , unk were n't properly unk .
unk unk had a passion for learning and for the arts , especially the performing arts . in addition to his holdings of theatrical material , he also owned 50,000 books , among them a great unk of unk , although , in fact , he was an unk . that did n't keep him from making a great deal of money manufacturing gold unk for the russian orthodox church . he owned a unk house , in which , according to his daughter , four enormous rooms were filled with his collection .
after the revolution , when everything he owned was unk by the unk , he was put in charge of the state 's first museum of theater and music , unk in unk square . in effect , he became the official unk of his former collection , which grew unk and soon included several thousand unk .
despite the unk to which her father was subject in those years , ms. unk unk that he must have been happy to be allowed to remain with the unk he had assembled so unk . while she found out soon after the war that he had unk during the unk of unk , she did n't know until the unk arrived from the soviet union with the unk of this exhibition that he had died of unk on a unk in the museum . though weakened by unk , he was unwilling to unk in case the collection was unk and needed to be saved .
as it happened , the collection survived intact . today , the unk state museum of theater and music owns some 400,000 items . for americans , the most interesting of the 400 items on display in new york include designs by the unk unk unk ( unk ) for the russian productions of important early unk paris unk . no less illuminating are the designs from unk 's `` sleeping beauty '' ( unk ) , `` unk '' ( unk ) and `` unk '' ( unk ) , which shed light on the role played by unk in the unk of this great unk . there also is much to be learned from the early stage photographs of unk 's work , which , though posed , extend our knowledge of its theatrical unk .
unk , the unk of unk unk , emerges as the show 's hero , whether perceived through scenes from his unk or through unk of the unk whose technique and unk his unk played a unk role in shaping . among the most important of the unk unk is unk unk , represented in a series of unk photographs . the unk of nicholas ii until his unk to unk of unk , she dominated the imperial unk of st. unk as much through her unk as through her unk . even unk unk , the unk enemy of unk , found her unk . a unk photograph shows unk unk on a unk unk in her st. unk mansion . clearly visible in the background is the unk from which unk was to unk the revolution .
the unk material is less interesting . the unk unk never appeared in russia and most of the important unk are in the west . george unk , to whom ms. unk was married as a unk in unk and who began his career as an artistic revolutionary , also gets short unk . better by far is the representation unk the unk dance that unk in the u.s.s.r. until unk unk during the unk years . the presence of so much material concerning unk unk , the leading unk of the unk unk school , and virtually unknown in this country , is particularly welcome .
less welcome is the random nature of the exhibition , which has no point to make beyond the unk fact that there are unk in the unk state museum of theater and music . unk and unk -- did we really need to see unk unk 's tea set or unk unk 's unk ? -- the show invites unk , and thus unk , unk .
while it 's an unk achievement for the unk gallery to have organized the show in only three months , the time has surely come to present this kind of material in ways that reveal a context and a point of view . even the title is misleading : the exhibition covers unk , not in russia , but only in what is now unk . it also begins before unk and ends after unk . in unk the catalog , the gallery has missed a great opportunity to document a lot of rare material . though unk , the publication is unk and often simply unk . clearly , no dance unk should unk the show , but it 's only a unk for the serious , unk unk we really need .
the show closes in new york on oct. 20 and unk in unk , n.y. , on may 19 at the national museum of dance , its unk .
`` in our business , '' says unk bull chairman francis unk , `` one and one sometimes add up to 1.1 , or 1.2 , but rarely two . ''
mr. unk is talking about mergers , not unk . bull , the unk computer maker , earlier this month agreed to buy the computer business of zenith electronics corp. for as much as $ unk million , but denies this is a merger . bull says it intends to retain existing management of the u.s. unit and keep the zenith label , while selling zenith personal computers -- a product line in which bull had been lagging -- as part of bull unk systems .
merger or not , the zenith acquisition is a key part of mr. unk 's plan to grow bull -- the world 's unk biggest computer company last year -- into a profitable member of the top five or six computer makers . it wo n't be easy . bull had a first-half net loss of unk million francs ( $ unk million ) on revenue of 14 billion francs ( $ unk billion ) . mr. unk says his objective remains posting a small profit for this year , but he is n't certain the company will make it into the black .
he adds that any full-year loss wo n't be `` anywhere as big '' as the first-half loss , which was caused in part by production problems , `` which are being solved , '' at the company 's unk , france , unk plant and a squeeze on profit margins because of growing competition . in any event , bull thus far has n't had any trouble finding the cash to fund its acquisitions . bull posted a profit in 1988 of unk million francs on revenue of unk billion francs .
the other key to bull 's future health is its other u.s. leg . bull last year increased to unk % its controlling interest in honeywell bull inc . honeywell inc. retains 15.6 % , and nec corp. of japan owns the remaining 15 % . in addition , bull renamed the u.s. company bull unk information services inc . bull unk reports to mr. unk as chairman of holding company cie. des machines bull . during the past decade or so , bull and honeywell tried various approaches to combining their businesses , none of which really unk . `` we were spending all our unk unk , while unk the world was changing at unk speed , '' mr. unk says .
but now , with bull in firm control , these u.s. operations are key unk in mr. unk 's plans to ensure that bull remains one of the unk or so world-wide , unk computer companies likely to survive the 1990s . to do so , bull is unk itself firmly in the u.s. , where , says mr. unk , a lot of the best people and research are . the zenith buy means bull will unk 22 % of its revenue from the u.s. -- up from 18 % previously -- and the company spends 30 % of its unk unk research and development budget in the u.s .
keeping zenith relatively unk , says mr. unk , makes sense because `` they are completely different unk , making personal computers , like zenith , and making mainframes like bull . '' he says unk : `` we are n't fast enough . we { mainframe makers } live in cycles of four or five years of development and product life . they { pc makers } get six months of development and maybe 12 months of shelf life . they can afford to take some risks and fail . ''
`` it is absolutely essential to keep zenith 's unk , its extraordinary force , '' the unk mr. unk adds .
`` our unk is to be able to respond to any question our clients ask , '' says mr. unk , who joined bull seven years ago after unk as chief financial officer of a water company and various posts in the french treasury . `` we want to be able to offer complete systems in specialized areas , like banking , ranging from the unk machines to the unk workstation to the unk equipment to the mainframe computer . to do these we need to make all the basic building blocks . ''
mr. unk succeeded unk stern as chairman of bull in june , and like his predecessor , he is a unk for `` open software '' -- that is standards that will work on the machines of various makers -- in order to give smaller companies like bull a chance against industry giants . mr. unk , mr. stern 's no. 2 since 1982 , unk the task of making bull the biggest and unk european unk computer company , competing unk with the likes of international business machines corp. , unisys corp. , and a handful of japanese companies . counting only sales of computer equipment , bull is already the biggest in europe , ahead of unk ag of west germany and unk . c. olivetti & co. of italy , mr. unk says .
mr. unk , an intense , unk product of france 's unk `` unk national unk '' likes to go rock climbing in his spare time , and used to practice the unk art of unk . he will discuss frankly bull 's past problems ; when asked if the company has suffered from an unk image , he readily agrees . he allows that the products of all computer makers are getting more and more alike -- `` a certain unk '' he calls it -- and that specialized service will make the difference in the future . `` how we manage the problem of service will make all the difference between now and 1995 , '' he says . after having added zenith pcs to the bull stable , mr. unk says , the company will be better armed for battle especially in europe . `` our biggest asset is that we are well unk in europe , and europe will be the unk growing market in the world over the next 10 years . '' but the unk of europe will happen , in part , from the u.s .
`` the information industry is global , '' says mr. unk , `` but the image of that industry is created in the u.s. , so we must be present in the u.s. in order to be known everywhere else . the u.s. represents 45 % of the world information market , so it 's 45 % of our world . the technology and the human resources are there , and since the unk resource for us is people , and the people are in the u.s. , so are we . that 's the whole story . ''
with stock prices unk near record levels , a number of companies have been announcing stock unk .
but investors trying to play all the unk may find that stock unk are a lot like cotton candy : they look unk , but there 's hardly any substance . and they can even leave a unk problem , in the form of higher brokerage commissions .
`` a stock split unk by a cash dividend increase is like giving somebody five unk for a $ 5 bill . you 've got a unk unk , but it has no economic significance unk , '' says unk unk , a partner at goldman , sachs & co .
in a typical split , a company increases the number of shares it has outstanding , with each unk participating on the basis of existing holdings . with a 2-for-1 split , for example , an investor who owned 100 shares before the split would have 200 shares afterward . the stock 's price usually falls to reflect the greater number of shares , assuming no other changes at the company .
companies usually split their shares in the hope that a lower share price will attract more individual investors , increase trading volume and improve the stock 's liquidity . the theory is that a stock selling for $ 20 or $ 30 a share will be more unk to individuals than one selling for more than $ 100 -- especially for investors who like to buy round lots of 100 shares .
take l.a. gear inc. , a fast-growing designer and marketer of athletic unk that had a 2-for-1 split last month . the main reason for the split was `` to make the stock more attractive to the retail buyer , '' says elliott j. unk , the company 's executive vice president and chief financial officer .
but if a stock suddenly becomes more attractive to the unk , should n't that boost its price ? after all , l.a. gear was selling for around $ 60 a share when the split was announced on aug. 24 , then soared to more than $ 75 a share before splitting in late september . yesterday , the stock closed at $ unk .
mr. unk unk at the idea that his company 's price surge was caused by the split . `` if it were that easy to take a stock from 60 to 75 , i think a lot of other companies would be doing it , '' he says . while a split `` does create more demand for the stock , '' he says , `` i just do n't think it 's that much of a factor . ''
investment managers and others agree . while a stock split accompanied by a dividend increase can pack a powerful unk , a split by itself `` has no lasting impact on the stock price , '' says mr. unk of goldman sachs .
adds james l. unk , senior vice president at the new york stock exchange : `` we 've done research on this , and it shows a split really does n't to seem to matter significantly . ''
even if unk did affect stock prices , some unk argue that it would be unk for investors to try to take advantage of them . in their view , financial markets tend to anticipate news . thus any impact from a split would already be incorporated in a stock 's price by the time the split was announced , they argue .
`` normally , the investor is n't able to benefit '' by buying a company 's stock immediately after news of a split , says frank k. unk , a unk unk professor of finance and co-author of a 1981 study on unk . `` by the time the average investor unk the news , traders already have acted and the stock already has moved . ''
a few money managers even say a stock split sometimes may represent a sell signal . `` remember the old wall street unk : buy on the rumor and sell on the news , '' says samuel unk jr. , a managing director at unk , stevens & clark in boston .
unk can also mean a bigger expense for investors when they buy or sell shares . that 's because brokerage houses often unk their commission rates using a complex formula based partly on the number of shares being traded .
for example , a merrill lynch official says that firm 's commission on 100 shares of a $ 40 stock would be about $ 97 . but the commission would jump to about $ 115 to trade 200 shares of a $ 20 stock -- even though the dollar amount of the trade would be exactly the same . another large firm gave similar figures : the standard commission on 100 shares of a $ 40 stock would be $ 91 , but the commission would jump to $ unk to trade 200 shares of a $ 20 stock .
`` stock unk are the biggest unk on wall street , '' contends unk r. unk , a new york investor . `` the only thing that changes with a split is the brokerage commissions , and they often go up sharply . if you 're an active investor , you have to take into account the transaction costs . ''
some corporate executives also question the idea that more shares are better . among these is warren e. buffett , chairman and chief executive officer of unk unk inc. , whose stock closed yesterday on the new york stock exchange at $ unk a share .
`` we often are asked why unk does not split its stock , '' he wrote in the company 's 1983 annual report . `` the assumption behind this question usually appears to be that a split would be a unk action . we disagree . ''
in the lengthy discussion that followed , mr. buffett said : `` we want { shareholders } who think of themselves as business owners with the intention of staying a long time . and , we want those who keep their eyes focused on business results , not market prices . ''
unk his feelings on the subject , mr. buffett once sent a unk unk to a friend , unk him good health and saying : `` may you live until unk unk . ''
still , many companies like unk as an unk marketing tool that generates favorable publicity and helps broaden their shareholder base .
a stock split is `` a nice exercise in cosmetics , but that 's about all , '' says james h. unk , senior vice president and head of the unk division at cigna investments inc . `` it 's a small net positive because it can improve the unk of a particular stock . but it 's really of very little significance . ''
a split 's impact , if any , can depend on the company involved and the price of that company 's stock , says john p. rosenthal , senior partner of unk , rosenthal & co . but he adds that any impact from a split `` really is very short-term . ''
advises michael unk , a managing director at oppenheimer & co : `` just ignore unk . '' in his view , `` they 're unk for the long-term investor . look only at the fundamentals of a company , not whether it unk its stock . ''
federal industries ltd. said it agreed with unk led by unk inc. to issue 75 million canadian dollars ( $ unk million ) principal amount of 9 % convertible subordinated debentures . federal industries , a diversified manufacturing , distribution and transportation concern based in unk , unk , said the debentures will be convertible until their 1999 maturity into the company 's class a shares at c$ unk a share . federal industries said c$ 54 million of the proceeds will be used to finance its previously reported plan to buy unk smith canada ltd. , a unk chain , and the balance to repay short-term debt .

securities analysts are using terms like `` unk syndrome '' and `` clearing the unk '' to describe the generally disappointing results that commercial banks are expected to report in the coming weeks .
a number of major banks have chosen to make huge unk to their loan-loss reserves in the third quarter , either for troubled loans to latin american nations , unk real-estate loans in this country or bad loans to companies involved in leveraged buy-outs .
the banks hope to get the bad news behind them now , so that their earnings -- and their stock prices -- can rebound in the coming quarters .
j.p. morgan & co. has effectively unk any problems that its unk loan portfolio could pose in the future by announcing a $ 2 billion addition to reserves for the quarter . as a result , morgan will post a loss for the quarter and year .
similarly , manufacturers hanover corp. made a big addition to reserves for unk debt that will cause it to post a loss . chase manhattan corp. on wednesday , as expected , reported a net loss for the third quarter of $ 1.11 billion , or $ unk a share , following a massive addition to reserves for possible losses on loans primarily to developing countries .

with all this disappointing news , analysts would n't be surprised to see other banks , particularly those with loans to developing countries , use the spate of unk by others as an opportunity to clean up their own balance sheets .
the nation 's biggest banking company , citicorp , is n't expected to follow the lead of manufacturers , chase and morgan with a massive boost in reserves . nevertheless , analysts expect citicorp 's third quarter will be near its level for the same period a year ago and therefore somewhat disappointing .
many analysts were expecting generally weak third-quarter results anyway due to continued rises in unk loans and pressure on interest-rate margins .
unk , unk & woods inc. , a securities firm specializing in bank stocks , estimates that third-quarter results will rise 8 % from the year-ago figure for unk regional banks that it follows . that 's the smallest increase this year .
the principal reason for the slower growth is the narrowing difference in interest rates on loans and the cost of unk consumer deposits . unk estimates this difference will shrink to unk percentage points in the third quarter , the lowest level in a year .
further deterioration in domestic loan quality is adding to the pressure on earnings . nonperforming real-estate loans in new england continue to climb , and the number of highly leveraged commercial loans that have gotten into trouble is rising . hooker international , unk furniture co. , unk financial group inc. , integrated resources inc. and resorts international inc. are some of the more prominent troubled concerns .

SCENE 1: [wind] [clop clop clop] 
KING ARTHUR: Whoa there!  [clop clop clop] 
SOLDIER #1: Halt!  Who goes there?
ARTHUR: It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
SOLDIER #1: Pull the other one!
ARTHUR: I am, ...  and this is my trusty servant Patsy.  We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot.  I must speak with your lord and master.
SOLDIER #1: What?  Ridden on a horse?
ARTHUR: Yes!
SOLDIER #1: You're using coconuts!
ARTHUR: What?
SOLDIER #1: You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin' 'em together.
ARTHUR: So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea, through--
SOLDIER #1: Where'd you get the coconuts?
ARTHUR: We found them.
SOLDIER #1: Found them?  In Mercea?  The coconut's tropical!
ARTHUR: What do you mean?
SOLDIER #1: Well, this is a temperate zone.
ARTHUR: The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land?
SOLDIER #1: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
ARTHUR: Not at all.  They could be carried.
SOLDIER #1: What?  A swallow carrying a coconut?
ARTHUR: It could grip it by the husk!
SOLDIER #1: It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple question of weight ratios!  A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.
ARTHUR: Well, it doesn't matter.  Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
SOLDIER #1: Listen.  In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?
ARTHUR: Please!
SOLDIER #1: Am I right?
ARTHUR: I'm not interested!
SOLDIER #2: It could be carried by an African swallow!
SOLDIER #1: Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow.  That's my point.
SOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah, I agree with that.
ARTHUR: Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?!
SOLDIER #1: But then of course a-- African swallows are non-migratory.
SOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah...
SOLDIER #1: So they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway...  [clop clop clop] 
SOLDIER #2: Wait a minute!  Supposing two swallows carried it together?
SOLDIER #1: No, they'd have to have it on a line.
SOLDIER #2: Well, simple!  They'd just use a strand of creeper!
SOLDIER #1: What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
SOLDIER #2: Well, why not?

DEAD PERSON: I'm getting better!  
CUSTOMER: No you're not.  You'll be stone dead in a moment.
CART-MASTER: Oh, I can't take him like that.  It's against regulations.

CART-MASTER: I can't take him.
DEAD PERSON: I feel fine!
CUSTOMER: Well, do us a favor.
CART-MASTER: I can't.
CUSTOMER: Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes?  He won't be long.
CART-MASTER: No, I've got to go to the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
CUSTOMER: Well, when's your next round?
CART-MASTER: Thursday.
DEAD PERSON: I think I'll go for a walk.
CUSTOMER: You're not fooling anyone you know.  Look, isn't there something you can do?
DEAD PERSON: [singing] I feel happy...  I feel happy.  [whop] 
CUSTOMER: Ah, thanks very much.
CART-MASTER: Not at all.  See you on Thursday.
CUSTOMER: Right.  All right.  [howl] [clop clop clop] Who's that then?
CART-MASTER: I dunno.  Must be a king.
CUSTOMER: Why?
CART-MASTER: He hasn't got shit all over him.
SCENE 3: [thud] [King Arthur music] [thud thud thud] [King Arthur music stops] 
ARTHUR: Old woman!
DENNIS: Man!
ARTHUR: Man.  Sorry.  What knight live in that castle over there?
DENNIS: I'm thirty-seven.
ARTHUR: I-- what?
DENNIS: I'm thirty-seven.  I'm not old.
ARTHUR: Well, I can't just call you 'Man'.
DENNIS: Well, you could say 'Dennis'.
ARTHUR: Well, I didn't know you were called 'Dennis'.
DENNIS: Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you?
ARTHUR: I did say 'sorry' about the 'old woman', but from the behind you looked--
DENNIS: What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior!
ARTHUR: Well, I am king!
DENNIS: Oh king, eh, very nice.  And how d'you get that, eh?  By exploiting the workers!  By 'anging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society.  If there's ever going to be any progress with the--
WOMAN: Dennis, there's some lovely filth down here.  Oh!  How d'you do?
ARTHUR: How do you do, good lady.  I am Arthur, King of the Britons.  Who's castle is that?
WOMAN: King of the who?
ARTHUR: The Britons.
WOMAN: Who are the Britons?
ARTHUR: Well, we all are.  We are all Britons, and I am your king.
WOMAN: I didn't know we had a king.  I thought we were an autonomous collective.
DENNIS: You're fooling yourself.  We're living in a dictatorship.  A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes--
WOMAN: Oh, there you go, bringing class into it again.
DENNIS: That's what it's all about.  If only people would hear of--
ARTHUR: Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  Who lives in that castle?
WOMAN: No one live there.
ARTHUR: Then who is your lord?
WOMAN: We don't have a lord.
ARTHUR: What?
DENNIS: I told you.  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.  We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
ARTHUR: Yes.
DENNIS: But all the decision of that officer have to be ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting--
ARTHUR: Yes, I see.
DENNIS: By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs,--
ARTHUR: Be quiet!
DENNIS: But by a two-thirds majority in the case of more major--
ARTHUR: Be quiet!  I order you to be quiet!
WOMAN: Order, eh?  Who does he think he is?  Heh.
ARTHUR: I am your king!
WOMAN: Well, I didn't vote for you.
ARTHUR: You don't vote for kings.
WOMAN: Well, how did you become king then?
ARTHUR: The Lady of the Lake, ... [angels sing] ... her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. [singing stops] That is why I am your king!
DENNIS: Listen, strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
ARTHUR: Be quiet!
DENNIS: Well, but you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
ARTHUR: Shut up!
DENNIS: I mean, if I went 'round saying I was an emperor just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!
ARTHUR: Shut up, will you.  Shut up!
DENNIS: Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system.
ARTHUR: Shut up!
DENNIS: Oh!  Come and see the violence inherent in the system!  Help, help!  I'm being repressed!
ARTHUR: Bloody peasant!
DENNIS: Oh, what a give-away.  Did you hear that?  Did you hear that, eh?  That's what I'm on about.  Did you see him repressing me?  You saw it, didn't you

BLACK KNIGHT: Umm! [clop clop clop] 
ARTHUR: You fight with the strength of many men, Sir Knight. [pause] I am Arthur, King of the Britons. [pause] I seek the finest and the bravest knights in the land to join me in my court at Camelot. [pause] You have proved yourself worthy.  Will you join me? [pause] You make me sad.  So be it.  Come, Patsy.
BLACK KNIGHT: None shall pass.
ARTHUR: What?
BLACK KNIGHT: None shall pass.
ARTHUR: I have no quarrel with you, good Sir Knight, but I must cross this bridge.
BLACK KNIGHT: Then you shall die.
ARTHUR: I command you, as King of the Britons, to stand aside!
BLACK KNIGHT: I move for no man.
ARTHUR: So be it!
ARTHUR and BLACK KNIGHT: Aaah!, hiyaah!, etc. [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's left arm off] 
ARTHUR: Now stand aside, worthy adversary.
BLACK KNIGHT: 'Tis but a scratch.
ARTHUR: A scratch?  Your arm's off!
BLACK KNIGHT: No, it isn't.
ARTHUR: Well, what's that then?
BLACK KNIGHT: I've had worse.
ARTHUR: You liar!
BLACK KNIGHT: Come on, you pansy! [clang] Huyah! [clang] Hiyaah! [clang] Aaaaaaaah! [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's right arm off]

BLACK KNIGHT: Oh, had enough, eh?

BLACK KNIGHT: Yes I have.
ARTHUR: Look!
BLACK KNIGHT: Just a flesh wound. [kick]

BLACK KNIGHT: Chicken! [kick] Chickennn!

ARTHUR: You'll what?
BLACK KNIGHT: Come here!

BLACK KNIGHT: I'm invincible!
ARTHUR: You're a looney.
BLACK KNIGHT: The Black Knight always triumphs!  Have at you!  Come on then. [whop] [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's last leg off] 
BLACK KNIGHT: Ooh.  All right, we'll call it a draw.
ARTHUR: Come, Patsy.
BLACK KNIGHT: Oh.  Oh, I see.  Running away, eh?  You yellow bastards!  Come back here and take what's coming to you.  I'll bite your legs off

VILLAGER #2: Yes.
VILLAGER #1: Yes.  Yeah, a bit.
VILLAGER #3: A bit.
VILLAGERS #1 and #2: A bit.
VILLAGER #3: A bit.
VILLAGER #1: She has got a wart.
RANDOM: [cough] 
BEDEVERE: What makes you think she is a witch?
VILLAGER #3: Well, she turned me into a newt.
BEDEVERE: A newt?
VILLAGER #3: I got better.
VILLAGER #2: Burn her anyway!
VILLAGER #1: Burn!
CROWD: Burn her!  Burn!  Burn her! ...
BEDEVERE: Quiet!  Quiet!  Quiet!  Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
VILLAGER #1: Are there?

CROWD: Tell us!  Tell us! ...

VILLAGER #2: Burn!

VILLAGER #1: More witches!
VILLAGER #3: Shh!
VILLAGER #2: Wood!
BEDEVERE: So, why do witches burn? [pause] 
VILLAGER #3: B--...  'cause they're made of...  wood?
BEDEVERE: Good!  Heh heh.
CROWD: Oh yeah.  Oh.
BEDEVERE: So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?
VILLAGER #1: Build a bridge out of her.
BEDEVERE: Ah, but can you not also make bridges out of stone?

ARTHUR: A duck!
CROWD: Oooh.
BEDEVERE: Exactly.  So, logically...
VILLAGER #1: If...  she...  weighs...  the same as a duck, ...  she's made of wood.
BEDEVERE: And therefore?
VILLAGER #2: A witch!
VILLAGER #1: A witch!
CROWD: A witch!  A witch! ...
VILLAGER #4: Here is a duck.  Use this duck. [quack quack quack] 
BEDEVERE: We shall use my largest scales.
CROWD: Ohh!  Ohh!  Burn the witch!  Burn the witch!  Burn her!  Burn her!  Burn her!  Burn her!  Burn her!  Burn her!  Burn her!  Ahh!  Ahh...
BEDEVERE: Right.  Remove the supports! [whop] [clunk] [creak]

WITCH: It's a fair cop.
VILLAGER #3: Burn her!
CROWD: Burn her!  Burn her!  Burn her!  Burn!  Burn! ...
BEDEVERE: Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
ARTHUR: I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
BEDEVERE: My liege!
ARTHUR: Good Sir Knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join us at the Round Table?
BEDEVERE: My liege!  I would be honored.
ARTHUR: What is your name?
BEDEVERE: Bedevere, my liege.
ARTHUR: Then I dub you Sir Bedevere, Knight of the Round Table
NARRATOR: The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow: Sir Lancelot the Brave; Sir Gallahad the Pure; and Sir Robin the-not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol, and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill; and the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.  Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries: the Knights of the Round Table
SCENE 6: [clop clop clop] 
SIR BEDEVERE: And that, my liege, is how we know the earth to be banana-shaped.
ARTHUR: This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
BEDEVERE: Oh, certainly, sir.
SIR LAUNCELOT: Look, my liege! [trumpets] 
ARTHUR: Camelot!
SIR GALAHAD: Camelot!
LAUNCELOT: Camelot!
PATSY: It's only a model.
ARTHUR: Shh!  Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home.  Let us ride... to...  Camelot! [in medieval hall] 
KNIGHTS: [singing] We're knights of the round table.  We dance when e'er we're able.  We do routines and chorus scenes With footwork impeccable.  We dine well here in Camelot.  We eat ham and jam and spam a lot [dancing] We're knights of the Round Table. Our shows are formidable, But many times we're given rhymes That are quite unsingable. We're opera mad in Camelot. We sing from the diaphragm a lot [in dungeon] 
PRISONER: [clap clap clap clap] [in medieval hall] 
KNIGHTS: [tap-dancing] In war we're tough and able, Quite indefatigable.  Between our quests we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable.  It's a busy life in Camelot.
MAN: I have to push the pram a lot [outdoors] 
ARTHUR: Well, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot.  It is a silly place.
KNIGHTS: Right.  Right
SCENE 7: [clop clop clop] [boom boom] [angels sing] 
GOD: Arthur!  Arthur, King of the Britons!  Oh, don't grovel! [singing stops] One thing I can't stand, it's people groveling.
ARTHUR: Sorry. [boom] 
GOD: And don't apologise.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's 'sorry this' and 'forgive me that' and 'I'm not worthy'. [boom] What are you doing now?!
ARTHUR: I'm averting my eyes, O Lord.
GOD: Well, don't.  It's like those miserable Psalms-- they're so depressing. Now knock it off!
ARTHUR: Yes, Lord.
GOD: Right!  Arthur, King of the Britons, your Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times.
ARTHUR: Good idea, O Lord!
GOD: 'Course it's a good idea!  Behold! [angels sing] Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.  Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek this grail.  That is your purpose, Arthur...  the quest for the Holy Grail. [boom] [singing stops] 
LAUNCELOT: A blessing!  A blessing from the Lord!
GALAHAD: God be praised
SCENE 8: [King Arthur music] [clop clop clop] 
ARTHUR: Halt! [horn] Hallo! [pause] Hallo!
FRENCH GUARD: Allo!  Who is eet?
ARTHUR: It is King Arthur, and these are my Knights of the Round Table.  Who's castle is this?
FRENCH GUARD: This is the castle of my master Guy de Loimbard.
ARTHUR: Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest.  If he will give us food and shelter for the night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
FRENCH GUARD: Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen.  Uh, he's already got one, you see?
ARTHUR: What?
GALAHAD: He says they've already got one!
ARTHUR: Are you sure he's got one?
FRENCH GUARD: Oh, yes, it's very nice-a.  (I told him we already got one.)
ARTHUR: Well, u-- um, can we come up and have a look?
FRENCH GUARD: Of course not!  You are English types-a!
ARTHUR: Well, what are you then?
FRENCH GUARD: I'm French!  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king-a?!
GALAHAD: What are you doing in England?
FRENCH GUARD: Mind your own business!
ARTHUR: If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle by force!
FRENCH GUARD: You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!  Go and boil your bottom, sons of a silly person.  I blow my nose at you, so-called Arthur King, you and all your silly English k-nnnnniggets.  Thpppppt!  Thppt! Thppt!
GALAHAD: What a strange person.
ARTHUR: Now look here, my good man--
FRENCH GUARD: I don't wanna talk to you no more, you empty headed animal food trough wiper!  I fart in your general direction!  You mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!
GALAHAD: Is there someone else up there we could talk to?
FRENCH GUARD: No, now go away or I shall taunt you a second time-a! [sniff] 
ARTHUR: Now, this is your last chance.  I've been more than reasonable.
FRENCH GUARD: (Fetchez la vache.)
OTHER FRENCH GUARD: Quoi?
FRENCH GUARD: (Fetchez la vache!) [mooo] 
ARTHUR: If you do not agree to my commands, then I shall-- [twong] [mooooooo] Jesus Christ!
KNIGHTS: Christ! [thud] Ah!  Ohh!
ARTHUR: Right!  Charge!
KNIGHTS: Charge! [mayhem] 
FRENCH GUARD: Hey, this one is for your mother!  There you go. [mayhem] 
FRENCH GUARD: And this one's for your dad!
ARTHUR: Run away!
KNIGHTS: Run away!
FRENCH GUARD: Thppppt!
FRENCH GUARDS: [taunting] 
LAUNCELOT: Fiends!  I'll tear them apart!
ARTHUR: No, no.  No, no.
BEDEVERE: Sir!  I have a plan, sir.

ARTHUR: What happens now?
BEDEVERE: Well, now, uh, Launcelot, Galahad, and I, uh, wait until nightfall, and then leap out of the rabbit, taking the French, uh, by surprise.  Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!
ARTHUR: Who leaps out?
BEDEVERE: U-- u-- uh, Launcelot, Galahad, and I.  Uh, leap out of the rabbit, uh, and uh...
ARTHUR: Ohh.
BEDEVERE: Oh.  Um, l-- look, i-- i-- if we built this large wooden badger-- [clank] [twong] 
ARTHUR: Run away!
KNIGHTS: Run away!  Run away!  Run away!  Run away!  Run away!  Run away!  Run away! [CRASH] 
FRENCH GUARDS: Oh, haw haw haw haw!  Haw!  Haw haw heh..
SCENE 9: [clack] 
VOICE: Picture for Schools, take eight.
DIRECTOR: Action!
HISTORIAN: Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur.  The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise, and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion.  Arthur, having consulted his closest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually. [clop clop clop] Now, this is what they did: Launcelot--
KNIGHT: Aaaah! [slash] [KNIGHT kills HISTORIAN] 
HISTORIAN'S WIFE: Frank
SCENE 10: [trumpets] 
NARRATOR: The Tale of Sir Robin.  So each of the knights went their separate ways.  Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing, accompanied by his favorite minstrels.
MINSTREL: [singing] Bravely bold Sir Robin, rode forth from Camelot.  He was not afraid to die, O brave Sir Robin.  He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways.  Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!  He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp, Or to have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken.  To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away, And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin!
His head smashed in and his heart cut out, And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged, And his nostrils raped and his bottom burned off, And his pen--
SIR ROBIN: That's-- that's, uh-- that's enough music for now, lads.  Heh.  Looks like there's dirty work afoot.
DENNIS: Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom.
WOMAN: Oh, Dennis, forget about freedom.  We haven't got enough mud.
ALL HEADS: Halt!  Who art thou?
MINSTREL: [singing] He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who--
ROBIN: Shut up!  Um, n-- n-- n-- nobody really, I'm j-- j-- j-- ju-- just um, just passing through.
ALL HEADS: What do you want?
MINSTREL: [singing] To fight and--
ROBIN: Shut up!  Um, oo, a-- nothing, nothing really.  I, uh, j-- j-- just--just to um, just to p-- pass through, good Sir Knight.
ALL HEADS: I'm afraid not!
ROBIN: Ah.  W-- well, actually I-- I am a Knight of the Round Table.
ALL HEADS: You're a Knight of the Round Table?
ROBIN: I am.
LEFT HEAD: In that case I shall have to kill you.
MIDDLE HEAD: Shall I?
RIGHT HEAD: Oh, I don't think so.
MIDDLE HEAD: Well, what do I think?
LEFT HEAD: I think kill him.
RIGHT HEAD: Oh, let's be nice to him.
LEFT HEAD: Oh shut up.
ROBIN: Perhaps I could--
LEFT HEAD: And you.  Oh, quick!  Get the sword out.  I want to cut his headoff!
RIGHT HEAD: Oh, cut your own head off!
MIDDLE HEAD: Yes, do us all a favor!
LEFT HEAD: What?
RIGHT HEAD: Yapping on all the time.
MIDDLE HEAD: You're lucky.  You're not next to him.
LEFT HEAD: What do you mean?
MIDDLE HEAD: You snore!
LEFT HEAD: Oh, I don't.  Anyway, you've got bad breath.
MIDDLE HEAD: Well it's only because you don't brush my teeth.
RIGHT HEAD: Oh stop bitching and let's go have tea.
LEFT HEAD: Oh, all right.  All right.  All right.  We'll kill him first and then have tea and biscuits.
MIDDLE HEAD: Yes.
RIGHT HEAD: Oh, not biscuits.
LEFT HEAD: All right.  All right, not biscuits, but let's kill him anyway.
ALL HEADS: Right!
MIDDLE HEAD: He buggered off.
RIGHT HEAD: So he has.  He's scarper
MINSTREL: [singing] Brave Sir Robin ran away.
ROBIN: No!
MINSTREL: [singing] Bravely ran away away.
ROBIN: I didn't!
MINSTREL: [singing] When danger reared its ugly head, he bravely turned his tail and fled.
ROBIN: No!
MINSTREL: [singing] Yes, brave Sir Robin turned about
ROBIN: I didn't!
MINSTREL: [singing] And gallantly he chickened out, bravely taking to his feet.
ROBIN: I never did!
MINSTREL: [singing] He beat a very brave retreat.
ROBIN: All lies!
MINSTREL: [singing] Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin.
ROBIN: I never

SCENE 11: [trumpets] 
NARRATOR: The Tale of Sir Galahad. [boom] [wind] [howl] [howl] [boom] [angels singing] [howl] [boom] [howl] [boom] [pound pound pound] 
GALAHAD: Open the door!  Open the door! [pound pound pound] In the name of King Arthur, open the door! [squeak] [thump] [squeak] [boom] 
GIRLS: Hello!
ZOOT: Welcome gentle Sir Knight.  Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.
GALAHAD: The Castle Anthrax?
ZOOT: Yes.  Oh, it's not a very good name is it?  Oh, but we are nice and we will attend to your every, every need!
GALAHAD: You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
ZOOT: The what?
GALAHAD: The Grail.  It is here.
ZOOT: Oh, but you are tired, and you must rest awhile.  Midget!  Crapper!
MIDGET and CRAPPER: Yes, O Zoot?
ZOOT: Prepare a bed for our guest.
MIDGET and CRAPPER: Oh thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you! ...
ZOOT: Away, away varletesses.  The beds here are warm and soft, and very, very big.
GALAHAD: Well, look, I-- I-- uh--
ZOOT: What is your name, handsome knight?
GALAHAD: Sir Galahad...  the Chaste.
ZOOT: Mine is Zoot.  Just Zoot.  Oh, but come.
GALAHAD: Look, please!  In God's name, show me the Grail!
ZOOT: Oh, you have suffered much.  You are delirious.
GALAHAD: No, look.  I have seen it!  It is here, in this--
ZOOT: Sir Galahad!  You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.
GALAHAD: Well, I-- I-- uh--
ZOOT: Oh, I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life: bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear.  We are just not used to handsome knights.  Nay.  Nay.  Come.  Come.  You may lie here.  Oh, but you are wounded!
GALAHAD: No, no-- it's-- it's nothing.
ZOOT: Oh, you must see the doctors immediately!  No, no, please!  Lie down. [clap clap] 
PIGLET: Well, what seems to be the trouble?
GALAHAD: They're doctors?!
ZOOT: Uh, they have a basic medical training, yes.
GALAHAD: B-- but--
ZOOT: Oh, come, come.  You must try to rest.  Doctor Piglet!  Doctor Winston!  Practice your art.
WINSTON: Try to relax.
GALAHAD: Are you sure that's absolutely necessary?
PIGLET: We must examine you.
GALAHAD: There's nothing wrong with that!
PIGLET: Please.  We are doctors.
GALAHAD: Look!  This cannot be.  I am sworn to chastity.
PIGLET: Back to your bed!  At once!
GALAHAD: Torment me no longer.  I have seen the Grail!
PIGLET: There's no grail here.
GALAHAD: I have seen it!  I have seen it! [clank] I have seen--
GIRLS: Hello.
GALAHAD: Oh.
GIRLS: Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.
GALAHAD: Zoot!
DINGO: No, I am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.
GALAHAD: Oh, well, excuse me, I--
DINGO: Where are you going?
GALAHAD: I seek the Grail!  I have seen it, here in this castle!
DINGO: Oh no.  Oh, no!  Bad, bad Zoot!
GALAHAD: Well, what is it?
DINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!  She has been setting alight to our beacon, which, I have just remembered, is grail-shaped.  It's not the first time we've had this problem.
GALAHAD: It's not the real Grail?
DINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot!  She is a bad person and must pay the penalty.  Do you think this scene should have been cut?  We were so worried when the boys were writing it, but now, we're glad.  It's better than some of the previous scenes, I think.
LEFT HEAD: At least ours was better visually.
DENNIS: Well, at least ours was committed.  It wasn't just a string of pussy jokes.
OLD MAN: Get on with it.
TIM THE ENCHANTER: Yes, get on with it!
ARMY OF KNIGHTS: Yes, get on with it!
DINGO: Oh, I am enjoying this scene.
GOD: Get on with it!
DINGO: [sigh] Oh, wicked, wicked Zoot.  Oh, she is a naughty person, and she must pay the penalty.  And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment for setting alight the grail-shaped beacon.  You must tie her down on a bed and spank her.
GIRLS: A spanking!  A spanking!
DINGO: You must spank her well.  And after you have spanked her, you may deal with her as you like.  And then, spank me.
AMAZING: And spank me.
STUNNER: And me.
LOVELY: And me.
DINGO: Yes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking!
GIRLS: A spanking!  A spanking!  There is going to be a spanking tonight!
DINGO: And after the spanking, the oral sex.
GIRLS: The oral sex!  The oral sex!
GALAHAD: Well, I could stay a bit longer.
LAUNCELOT: Sir Galahad!
GALAHAD: Oh, hello.
LAUNCELOT: Quick!
GALAHAD: What?
LAUNCELOT: Quick!
GALAHAD: Why?
LAUNCELOT: You are in great peril!
DINGO: No he isn't.
LAUNCELOT: Silence, foul temptress!
GALAHAD: You know, she's got a point.
LAUNCELOT: Come on!  We will cover your escape!
GALAHAD: Look, I'm fine!
LAUNCELOT: Come on!
GIRLS: Sir Galahad!
GALAHAD: No.  Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!
DINGO: Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed!
GIRLS: Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed!
LAUNCELOT: No, Sir Galahad.  Come on!
GALAHAD: No!  Really!  Honestly, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily.
DINGO: Oh, yes.  Let him handle us easily.
GIRLS: Yes.  Let him handle us easily.
LAUNCELOT: No.  Quick!  Quick!
GALAHAD: Please!  I can defeat them!  There's only a hundred-and-fifty of them!
DINGO: Yes, yes!  He will beat us easily!  We haven't a chance.
GIRLS: We haven't a chance.  He will beat us easily... [boom] 
DINGO: Oh, shit.
LAUNCELOT: We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
GALAHAD: I don't think I was.
LAUNCELOT: Yes you were.  You were in terrible peril.
GALAHAD: Look, let me go back in there and face the peril.
LAUNCELOT: No, it's too perilous.
GALAHAD: Look, it's my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can.
LAUNCELOT: No, we've got to find the Holy Grail.  Come on!
GALAHAD: Oh, let me have just a little bit of peril?
LAUNCELOT: No.  It's unhealthy.
GALAHAD: I bet you're gay.
LAUNCELOT: No I'm not
NARRATOR: Sir Launcelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation, but they were still no nearer the Grail.  Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow's flight away, had discovered something.  Oh, that's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously.  I mean, they were more than two laden swallows' flights away-- four, really, if they had a coconut on a line between them.  I mean, if the birds were walking and dragging--
CROWD: Get on with it!
NARRATOR: Oh, anyway.  On to scene twenty-four, which is a smashing scene with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a vital clue, and in which there aren't any swallows, although I think you can hear a starling-- oooh
SCENE 12:
OLD MAN: Heh, hee ha ha hee hee!  Hee hee hee ha ha ha...
ARTHUR: And this enchanter of whom you speak, he has seen the Grail?
OLD MAN: ... Ha ha ha ha!  Heh, hee ha ha hee!  Ha hee ha!  Ha ha ha ha...
ARTHUR: Where does he live?
OLD MAN: ... Heh heh heh heh...
ARTHUR: Old man, where does he live?
OLD MAN: ... Hee ha ha ha.  He knows of a cave, a cave which no man has entered.
ARTHUR: And the Grail.  The Grail is there?
OLD MAN: There is much danger, for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril, which no man has ever crossed.
ARTHUR: But the Grail!  Where is the Grail?!
OLD MAN: Seek you the Bridge of Death.
ARTHUR: The Bridge of Death, which leads to the Grail?
OLD MAN: Heh, hee hee hee hee!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Hee ha ha..

ARTHUR: No!  Not the Knights Who Say 'Ni'!
HEAD KNIGHT: The same!
BEDEVERE: Who are they?
HEAD KNIGHT: We are the keepers of the sacred words: Ni, Peng, and Neee-wom!
RANDOM: Neee-wom!
ARTHUR: Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale!
HEAD KNIGHT: The Knights Who Say 'Ni' demand a sacrifice!
ARTHUR: Knights of Ni, we are but simple travellers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
HEAD KNIGHT: Ni!
KNIGHTS OF NI: Ni!  Ni!  Ni!  Ni!  Ni! ...
ARTHUR: Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Agh!
HEAD KNIGHT: We shall say 'ni' again to you if you do not appease us.
ARTHUR: Well, what is it you want?
HEAD KNIGHT: We want...  a shrubbery! [dramatic chord] 
ARTHUR: A what?
KNIGHTS OF NI: Ni!  Ni!  Ni!  Ni!
ARTHUR and PARTY: Ow!  Oh!
ARTHUR: Please, please!  No more!  We will find you a shrubbery.
HEAD KNIGHT: You must return here with a shrubbery or else you will never pass through this wood alive!
ARTHUR: O Knights of Ni, you are just and fair, and we will return with a shrubbery.
HEAD KNIGHT: One that looks nice.
ARTHUR: Of course.
HEAD KNIGHT: And not too expensive.
ARTHUR: Yes.
HEAD KNIGHT: Now...  go [trumpets]

SCENE 14:
NARRATOR: The Tale of Sir Launcelot.
FATHER: One day, lad, all this will be yours!
PRINCE HERBERT: What, the curtains?
FATHER: No.  Not the curtains, lad.  All that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys of this land!  This'll be your kingdom, lad.
HERBERT: But Mother--
FATHER: Father, lad.  Father.
HERBERT: B-- b-- but Father, I don't want any of that.
FATHER: Listen, lad.  I built this kingdom up from nothing.  When I started here, all there was was swamp.  Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em.  It sank into the swamp.  So, I built a second one.  That sank into the swamp.  So I built a third one.  That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp.  But the fourth one...  stayed up!  And that's what you're gonna get, lad: the strongest castle in these islands.
HERBERT: But I don't want any of that.  I'd rather--
FATHER: Rather what?!
HERBERT: I'd rather... [music] ... just...  sing!
FATHER: Stop that!  Stop that!  You're not going into a song while I'm here.  Now listen, lad.  In twenty minutes you're getting married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.
HERBERT: B-- but I don't want land.
FATHER: Listen, Alice,--
HERBERT: Herbert.
FATHER: 'Erbert.  We live in a bloody swamp.  We need all the land we can get.
HERBERT: But-- but I don't like her.
FATHER: Don't like her?!  What's wrong with her?!  She's beautiful.  She's rich.  She's got huge...  tracts o' land.
HERBERT: I know, but I want the-- the girl that I marry to have...  [music] ... a certain...  special...  something!
FATHER: Cut that out!  Cut that out!  Look, you're marrying Princess Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea! [smack] Guards!  Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
GUARD #1: Not to leave the room even if you come and get him.
GUARD #2: Hic!
FATHER: No, no.  Until I come and get him.
GUARD #1: Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.
FATHER: No, no.  No.  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
GUARD #1: And you'll come and get him.
GUARD #2: Hic!
FATHER: Right.
GUARD #1: We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
FATHER: No, no.  Leaving the room.
GUARD #1: Leaving the room.  Yes. [sniff] 
FATHER: All right?
GUARD #1: Right.
GUARD #2: Hic!
FATHER: Right.
GUARD #1: Oh, if-- if-- if-- uhh-- if-- if-- w-- ehh-- i-- if-- if we--
FATHER: Yes?  What is it?
GUARD #1: Oh, i-- if-- i-- oh--
FATHER: Look, it's quite simple.
GUARD #1: Uh...
FATHER: You just stay here, and make sure 'e doesn't leave the room.  Alright?
GUARD #2: Hic!
FATHER: Right.
GUARD #1: Oh, I remember.  Uhh, can he leave the room with us?
FATHER: N-- no no.  No.  You just keep him in here, and make sure he--
GUARD #1: Oh, yes.  We'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him--
FATHER: No, no, no, no.  Just keep him in here--
GUARD #1: Until you, or anyone else--
FATHER: No, not anyone else.  Just me.
GUARD #1: Just you.
GUARD #2: Hic!
FATHER: Get back.
GUARD #1: Get back.
FATHER: All right?
GUARD #1: Right.  We'll stay here until you get back.
GUARD #2: Hic!
FATHER: And, uh, make sure he doesn't leave.
GUARD #1: What?
FATHER: Make sure 'e doesn't leave.
GUARD #1: The Prince?
FATHER: Yes.  Make sure 'e doesn't leave.
GUARD #1: Oh, yes, of course.  
GUARD #2: Hic!
GUARD #1: Ah.  I thought you meant him.  You know, it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard.
FATHER: Is that clear?
GUARD #2: Hic!
GUARD #1: Oh, quite clear.  No problems.
FATHER: Right.  Where are you going?
GUARD #1: We're coming with you.
FATHER: No, no.  I want you to stay here and make sure 'e doesn't leave.
GUARD #1: Oh, I see.  Right.
HERBERT: But Father!
FATHER: Shut your noise, you!  And get that suit on! [music] And no singing!
GUARD #2: Hic!
FATHER: Oh, go and get a glass of water. [clank] [scribble scribble scribble fold fold] [twong]

CONCORDE: Thank you, sir!  Most kind.
LAUNCELOT: And again!  Over we go!  Good.  Steady!  And now, the big one!  Uuh!  Come on, Concorde! [thwonk] 
CONCORDE: Message for you, sir. [fwump] 
LAUNCELOT: Concorde!  Concorde!  Speak to me!  'To whoever finds this note: I have been imprisoned by my father, who wishes me to marry against my will.  Please, please, please come and rescue me.  I am in the Tall Tower of Swamp Castle.' At last!  A call!  A cry of distress!  This could be the sign that leads us to the Holy Grail!  Brave, brave Concorde, you shall not have died in vain!
CONCORDE: Uh, I'm-- I'm not quite dead, sir.
LAUNCELOT: Well, you shall not have been mortally wounded in vain!
CONCORDE: I-- I-- I think I c-- I could pull through, sir.
LAUNCELOT: Oh, I see.
CONCORDE: Actually, I think I'm all right to come with you, sir--
LAUNCELOT: No, no, sweet Concorde!  Stay here!  I will send help as soon as I have accomplished a daring and heroic rescue in my own particular...  [sigh] 
CONCORDE: Idiom, sir?
LAUNCELOT: Idiom!
CONCORDE: No, I feel fine, actually, sir.
LAUNCELOT: Farewell, sweet Concorde!
CONCORDE: I'll, um, I'll just stay here then.  Shall I, sir?  Yeah

PRINCESS LUCKY and GIRLS: [giggle giggle giggle] [outside castle]

SENTRY #1: 'Morning.
SENTRY #2: Oooh.
SENTRY #1: [ptoo] 
LAUNCELOT: Ha ha!  Hiyya!

GUARD #1: Now, you're not allowed to enter the room-- aaugh!
LAUNCELOT: O fair one, behold your humble servant Sir Launcelot of Camelot.  I have come to take y-- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
HERBERT: You got my note!
LAUNCELOT: Uh, well, I-- I got a-- a note.
HERBERT: You've come to rescue me!
LAUNCELOT: Uh, well, no.  You see, I hadn't--
HERBERT: I knew someone would.  I knew that somewhere out there...  [music] 
LAUNCELOT: Well, I--
HERBERT: ... there must be...  someone...
FATHER: Stop that!  Stop that!  Stop it!  Stop it!  Who are you?
HERBERT: I'm your son!
FATHER: No, not you.
LAUNCELOT: Uh, I am Sir Launcelot, sir.
HERBERT: He's come to rescue me, Father.
LAUNCELOT: Well, let's not jump to conclusions.
FATHER: Did you kill all those guards?
LAUNCELOT: Uh...  Oh, yes.  Sorry.
FATHER: They cost fifty pounds each!
LAUNCELOT: Well, I'm awfully sorry.  Um, I really can explain everything.
HERBERT: Don't be afraid of him, Sir Launcelot.  I've got a rope all ready.
FATHER: You killed eight wedding guests in all!
LAUNCELOT: Well, uh, you see, the thing is, I thought your son was a lady.
FATHER: I can understand that.
HERBERT: Hurry, Sir Launcelot!  Hurry!
FATHER: Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father, that's all!
LAUNCELOT: Well, I really didn't mean to...
FATHER: Didn't mean to?!  You put your sword right through his head!
LAUNCELOT: Oh, dear.  Is he all right?
FATHER: You even kicked the bride in the chest!  This is going to cost me a fortune!
LAUNCELOT: Well, I can explain.  I was in the forest, um, riding north from Camelot, when I got this note, you see--
FATHER: Camelot?  Are you from, uh, Camelot?
HERBERT: Hurry, Sir Launcelot!
LAUNCELOT: Uh, I am a Knight of King Arthur, sir.
FATHER: Very nice castle, Camelot.  Uh, very good pig country...
LAUNCELOT: Is it?
HERBERT: Hurry!  I'm ready!
FATHER: Would you, uh, like to come and have a drink?
LAUNCELOT: Well, that-- that's, uh, awfully nice of you, ...
HERBERT: I am ready!
LAUNCELOT: ... um, I mean to be so understanding. [thonk] Um, ... [woosh] 
HERBERT: Oooh!
LAUNCELOT: ... I'm afraid when I'm in this idiom, I sometimes get a bit, uh, sort of carried away.
FATHER: Oh, don't worry about that.
HERBERT: Oooh! [splat] 
SCENE 17:
GUESTS: [crying] 
FATHER: Well, this is the main hall.  We're going to have all this knocked through, and made into one big, uh, living room.
GUEST: There he is!
FATHER: Oh, bloody hell.
LAUNCELOT: Ha ha ha!  Hey!  Ha ha!
FATHER: Hold it!  Stop it!  Hold it!  Hold it!  Hold it!  Hold it!  Hold it!  Please!
LAUNCELOT: Sorry.  Sorry.  You see what I mean?  I just get carried away.  I'm really most awfully sorry.  Sorry!  Sorry, everyone.
GUEST #1: He's killed the best man!
GUESTS: [yelling] 
FATHER: Hold it!  Hold it!  Please!  Hold it!  This is Sir Launcelot from the Court of Camelot, a very brave and influential knight, and my special guest here today.
LAUNCELOT: Hello.
GUEST: He killed my auntie!
GUESTS: [yelling] 
FATHER: Please!  Please!  This is supposed to be a happy occasion!  Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who.  We are here today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of the holy wedlock.  Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert, has just fallen to his death.
GUESTS: Oh!  Oh no!
FATHER: But I don't want to think I've not lost a son, so much as...  gained a daughter! [clap clap clap] For, since the tragic death of her father--
GUEST #2: He's not quite dead!
FATHER: Since the near fatal wounding of her father--
GUEST #2: He's getting better!
FATHER: For, since her own father, who, when he seemed about to recover, suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him.
BRIDE'S FATHER: Uugh!
GUEST #2: Oh, he's died!
FATHER: And I want his only daughter to look upon me as her old dad, in a very real, and legally binding sense. [clap clap clap] And I feel sure that the merger-- er, the union between the Princess and the brave, but dangerous, Sir Launcelot of Camelot--
LAUNCELOT: What?
GUEST #2: Look!  The dead Prince!
GUESTS: Oooh!  The dead Prince!
CONCORDE: He's not quite dead.
HERBERT: No, I feel much better.
FATHER: You fell out of the Tall Tower, you creep!
HERBERT: No, I was saved at the last minute.
FATHER: How?!
HERBERT: Well, I'll tell you. [music] 
FATHER: Not like that!  Not like that!  No!  Stop it!
GUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell!  He's going to tell! ...
FATHER: Shut uuup!
GUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell! ...
FATHER: Shut up!
GUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell! ...
FATHER: Shut up!
GUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell! ...
FATHER: Not like that!
GUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell!  He's going to tell!  He's going to tell!  He's going to tell! ...
CONCORDE: Quickly, sir!
GUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell! ...
CONCORDE: Come this way!
GUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell!  He's going to tell! ...
LAUNCELOT: No!  It's not right for my idiom!
GUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell about his great escape...
LAUNCELOT: I must escape more...  [sigh] 
GUESTS: [singing] Oh, he fell a long, long way...
CONCORDE: Dramatically, sir?
LAUNCELOT: Dramatically!
GUESTS: [singing] But he's here with us today...
LAUNCELOT: Heee!  Hoa! [crash] Hoo!
GUESTS: [singing] What a wonderful escape!
LAUNCELOT: Excuse me.  Could, uh-- could somebody give me a push, please
SCENE 18: [King Arthur music] [clop clop clop] [rewr!  rewr!  rewr!  rewr!  rewr!  rewr!] 
ARTHUR: Old crone! [rewr!] [music stops] Is there anywhere in this town where we could buy a shrubbery? [dramatic chord] 
OLD CRONE: Who sent you?
ARTHUR: The Knights Who Say 'Ni'.
CRONE: Aggh!  No!  Never!  We have no shrubberies here.
ARTHUR: If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend and I will say...  we will say...  'ni'.

ROGER: Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can 'ni' at will to old ladies.  There is a pestilence upon this land.  Nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this period in history.
ARTHUR: Did you say 'shrubberies'?
ROGER: Yes.  Shrubberies are my trade.  I am a shrubber.  My name is Roger the Shrubber.  I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.
BEDEVERE: Ni!
ARTHUR: No!  No, no, no!  No
SCENE 19:
ARTHUR: O Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery.  May we go now?
HEAD KNIGHT: It is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly.  But there is one small problem.
ARTHUR: What is that?
HEAD KNIGHT: We are now...  no longer the Knights Who Say 'Ni'.
KNIGHTS OF NI: Ni!  Shh!
HEAD KNIGHT: Shh!  We are now the Knights Who Say 'Ecky-ecky-ecky-ecky-pikang-zoop-boing-goodem-zoo-owli-zhiv'.
RANDOM: Ni!
HEAD KNIGHT: Therefore, we must give you a test.
ARTHUR: What is this test, O Knights of-- Knights Who 'Til Recently Said 'Ni'?
HEAD KNIGHT: Firstly, you must find...  another shrubbery! [dramatic chord] 
ARTHUR: Not another shrubbery!
RANDOM: Ni!
HEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get the two-level effect with a little path running down the middle.
KNIGHTS OF NI: A path!  A path!  A path!  Ni!  Shh!  Ni!  Ni!  Ni!  Shh!  Shh! ...
HEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest...  with...  a herring! [dramatic chord] 
ARTHUR: We shall do no such thing!
HEAD KNIGHT: Oh, please!
ARTHUR: Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done.
KNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaugh!  Aaaugh!
HEAD KNIGHT: Augh!  Ohh!  Don't say that word.
ARTHUR: What word?
HEAD KNIGHT: I cannot tell, suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni cannot hear.
ARTHUR: How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is?
KNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!
HEAD KNIGHT: You said it again!
ARTHUR: What, 'is'?
KNIGHTS OF NI: Agh!  No, not 'is'.
HEAD KNIGHT: No, not 'is'.  You wouldn't get vary far in life not saying 'is'.
KNIGHTS OF NI: No, not 'is'.  Not 'is'.
BEDEVERE: My liege, it's Sir Robin!
MINSTREL: [singing] Packing it in and packing it up, And sneaking away and buggering up, And chickening out and pissing off home, Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge.
ARTHUR: Sir Robin!
ROBIN: My liege!  It's good to see you.
HEAD KNIGHT: Now he's said the word!  
ARTHUR: Surely you've not given up your quest for the Holy Grail?
MINSTREL: [singing] He is sneaking away and buggering up--
ROBIN: Shut up!  No, no.  No.  Far from it.
HEAD KNIGHT: He said the word again!
KNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!
ROBIN: I was looking for it.
KNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!
ROBIN: Uh, here-- here in this forest.
ARTHUR: No, it is far from this place.
KNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!
HEAD KNIGHT: Aaaaugh!  Stop saying the word!  The word...
ARTHUR: Oh, stop it!
KNIGHTS OF NI: ... we cannot hear!
HEAD KNIGHT: Ow!  He said it again!
ARTHUR: Patsy!
HEAD KNIGHT: Wait!  I said it!  I said it! [clop clop clop] Ooh!  I said it again!  And there again!  That's three 'it's!  Ohh!
KNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh
NARRATOR: And so, Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on their search to find the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in scene twenty-four.  Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Galahad, and there was much rejoicing.
KNIGHTS: Yay!  Yay! [woosh] 
NARRATOR: In the frozen land of Nador, they were forced to eat Robin's minstrels.
MINSTREL: [high-pitched] Get back!  Eee!
NARRATOR: And there was much rejoicing.
KNIGHTS: Yay!
NARRATOR: A year passed.
CARTOON CHARACTER: [shivering] 
NARRATOR: Winter changed into Spring.
CARTOON CHARACTER: Mmm, nice.
NARRATOR: Spring changed into Summer.
CARTOON CHARACTER: Oh.  Ahh.
NARRATOR: Summer changed back into Winter.
CARTOON CHARACTER: Oh?
NARRATOR: And Winter gave Spring and Summer a miss and went straight on into Autumn.
CARTOON CHARACTER: Aah. [snap] Oh!  Waa!
NARRATOR: Until one day..
SCENE 20: [King Arthur music] [clop clop clop] [music stops] [boom] 
KNIGHTS: Eh.  Oh.  See it?  Oh.  Oh.
ARTHUR: Knights!  Forward! [boom boom boom boom boom] [squeak] [boom boom boom boom] What manner of man are you that can summon up fire without flint or tinder?
TIM THE ENCHANTER: I...  am an enchanter.
ARTHUR: By what name are you known?
TIM: There are some who call me...  Tim?
ARTHUR: Greetings, Tim the Enchanter.
TIM: Greetings, King Arthur!
ARTHUR: You know my name?
TIM: I do. [zoosh] You seek the Holy Grail!
ARTHUR: That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden, O Tim.
TIM: Quite. [pweeng boom] [clap clap clap] 
ROBIN: Oh.
ARTHUR: Yes, we're-- we're looking for the Holy Grail.  Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.
KNIGHTS: Yeah.  Yes.  It is.  It is.  Yeah.  Yup.  Yup.  Hm.
ARTHUR: And so we're-- we're-- we're-- we're looking for it.
BEDEVERE: Yes, we are.
GALAHAD: Yeah.  
ROBIN: We are.  We are.
BEDEVERE: We have been for some time.
ROBIN: Ages.
BEDEVERE: Umhm.
ARTHUR: Uh-- uh, so, uh, anything that you could do to, uh-- to help, would be...  very...  helpful.
GALAHAD: Look, can you tell us where-- [boom] 
ARTHUR: Fine.  Um, I don't want to waste any more of your time, but, uh, I don't suppose you could, uh, tell us where we might find a, um-- find a, uh-- a, um-- a, uh--
TIM: A what...?
ARTHUR: A g-- a-- a g-- a g-- a-- a g--
TIM: A grail?!
ARTHUR: Yes, I think so.
ROBIN: Y-- y-- yes.
ARTHUR: Yes.
GALAHAD: Yup.
KNIGHTS: That's it...
TIM: Yes!
ROBIN: Oh.
ARTHUR: Oh.  Thank you.
ROBIN: Ahh.
GALAHAD: Oh.  Fine.
ARTHUR: Thank you.
ROBIN: Splendid.
KNIGHTS: Aah... [boom pweeng boom boom] 
ARTHUR: Look, um, you're a busy man, uh--
TIM: Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail.
KNIGHTS: Oh, thank you.  Oh...
TIM: To the north there lies a cave-- the cave of Caerbannog-- wherein, carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock, the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged... [boom] ... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
ARTHUR: Where could we find this cave, O Tim?
TIM: Follow.  But!  Follow only if ye be men of valor, for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived!  Bones of full fifty men lie strewn about its lair.  So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty, big, pointy teeth.
ARTHUR: What an eccentric performance
SCENE 21: [clop clop clop] [whinny whinny] 
GALAHAD: They're nervous, sire.
ARTHUR: Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.  Dis-mount!
TIM: Behold the cave of Caerbannog!
ARTHUR: Right!  Keep me covered.
GALAHAD: What with?
ARTHUR: W-- just keep me covered.
TIM: Too late! [dramatic chord] 
ARTHUR: What?
TIM: There he is!
ARTHUR: Where?
TIM: There!
ARTHUR: What, behind the rabbit?
TIM: It is the rabbit!
ARTHUR: You silly sod!
TIM: What?
ARTHUR: You got us all worked up!
TIM: Well, that's no ordinary rabbit.
ARTHUR: Ohh.
TIM: That's the most foul, cruel, and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on.
ROBIN: You tit!  I soiled my armor I was so scared!
TIM: Look, that rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide; it's a killer!
GALAHAD: Get stuffed!
TIM: He'll do you up a treat mate!
GALAHAD: Oh, yeah?
ROBIN: You mangy scots git!
TIM: I'm warning you!
ROBIN: What's he do, nibble your bum?
TIM: He's got huge, sharp-- eh-- he can leap about-- look at the bones!
ARTHUR: Go on, Bors.  Chop his head off!
BORS: Right!  Silly little bleeder.  One rabbit stew comin' right up!
TIM: Look! [squeak] 
BORS: Aaaugh! [dramatic chord] [clunk] 
ARTHUR: Jesus Christ!
TIM: I warned you!
ROBIN: I done it again!
TIM: I warned you, but did you listen to me?  Oh, no, you knew it all, didn't you?  Oh, it's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?  Well, it's always the same.  I always tell them--
ARTHUR: Oh, shut up!
TIM: Do they listen to me?
ARTHUR: Right!
TIM: Oh, no...
KNIGHTS: Charge! [squeak squeak squeak] 
KNIGHTS: Aaaaugh!, Aaaugh!, etc.
ARTHUR: Run away!  Run away!
KNIGHTS: Run away!  Run away! ...
TIM: Ha ha ha ha!  Ha haw haw!  Ha!  Ha ha!
ARTHUR: Right.  How many did we lose?
LAUNCELOT: Gawain.
GALAHAD: Ector.
ARTHUR: And Bors.  That's five.
GALAHAD: Three, sir.
ARTHUR: Three.  Three.  And we'd better not risk another frontal assault.  That rabbit's dynamite.
ROBIN: Would it help to confuse it if we run away more?
ARTHUR: Oh, shut up and go and change your armor.
GALAHAD: Let us taunt it!  It may become so cross that it will make a mistake.
ARTHUR: Like what?
GALAHAD: Well...  ooh.
LAUNCELOT: Have we got bows?
ARTHUR: No.
LAUNCELOT: We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
ARTHUR: Yes, of course!  The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch!  'Tis one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him!  Brother Maynard!  Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade!
MONKS: [chanting] Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem.  Pie Iesu domine, donaeis requiem.  Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem.  Pie Iesu domine, dona eisrequiem.
ARTHUR: How does it, um-- how does it work?
LAUNCELOT: I know not, my liege.
ARTHUR: Consult the Book of Armaments!
BROTHER MAYNARD: Armaments, Chapter Two, verses Nine to Twenty-one.
SECOND BROTHER: And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying,'O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou mayest blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.' And the Lord did grin, and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large chu--
MAYNARD: Skip a bit, Brother.
SECOND BROTHER: And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin.  Then, shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.  Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three.  Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.  Five is right out.  Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.'
MAYNARD: Amen.
KNIGHTS: Amen.
ARTHUR: Right!  One...  two...  five!
GALAHAD: Three, sir!
ARTHUR: Three! [angels sing] [boom] 
SCENE 22:
ARTHUR: There!  Look!
LAUNCELOT: What does it say?
GALAHAD: What language is that?
ARTHUR: Brother Maynard!  You are a scholar.
MAYNARD: It's Aramaic!
GALAHAD: Of course!  Joseph of Arimathea!
LAUNCELOT: 'Course!
ARTHUR: What does it say?
MAYNARD: It reads, 'Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Arimathea.  He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail in the Castle of uuggggggh'.
ARTHUR: What?
MAYNARD: '...  the Castle of uuggggggh'.
BEDEVERE: What is that?
MAYNARD: He must have died while carving it.
LAUNCELOT: Oh, come on!
MAYNARD: Well, that's what it says.
ARTHUR: Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve 'aaggggh'.  He'd just say it!
MAYNARD: Well, that's what's carved in the rock!
GALAHAD: Perhaps he was dictating.
ARTHUR: Oh, shut up.  Well, does it say anything else?
MAYNARD: No.  Just, 'uuggggggh'.
LAUNCELOT: Aauuggghhh.
ARTHUR: Aaauggh.
BEDEVERE: Do you suppose he meant the Camaaaaaargue?
GALAHAD: Where's that?
BEDEVERE: France, I think.
LAUNCELOT: Isn't there a Saint Aauuuves in Cornwall?
ARTHUR: No, that's Saint Ives.
LAUNCELOT: Oh, yes.  Saint Iiiives.
KNIGHTS: Iiiiives.
BEDEVERE: Oooohoohohooo!
LAUNCELOT: No, no.  'Aauuuuugh', at the back of the throat.  Aauuugh.
BEDEVERE: N-- no.  No, no, no, no.  'Oooooooh', in surprise and alarm.
LAUNCELOT: Oh, you mean sort of a 'aaaah'!
BEDEVERE: Yes, but I-- aaaaaah!
ARTHUR: Oooh!
GALAHAD: My God! [dramatic chord] [roar] 
MAYNARD: It's the legendary Black Beast of Aaauugh! [Black Beast of Aaauugh eats BROTHER MAYNARD] 
BEDEVERE: That's it!  That's it!
ARTHUR: Run away!
KNIGHTS: Run away! [roar] Run away!  Run awaaay!  Run awaaaaay! [roar] Keep running! [boom] [roar] Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh! ...
BEDEVERE: We've lost him. [roar] 
KNIGHTS: Aagh!
NARRATOR: As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless, when suddenly, the animator suffered a fatal heart attack.
ANIMATOR: Ulk! [thump] 
NARRATOR: The cartoon peril was no more.  The quest for Holy Grail could continue.
SCENE 23: [gurgle] 
GALAHAD: There it is!
ARTHUR: The Bridge of Death!
ROBIN: Oh, great.
ARTHUR: Look!  There's the old man from scene twenty-four!
BEDEVERE: What is he doing here?
ARTHUR: He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.  He asks each traveller five questions--
GALAHAD: Three questions.
ARTHUR: Three questions.  He who answers the five questions--
GALAHAD: Three questions.
ARTHUR: Three questions may cross in safety.
ROBIN: What if you get a question wrong?
ARTHUR: Then you are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.
ROBIN: Oh, I won't go.
GALAHAD: Who's going to answer the questions?
ARTHUR: Sir Robin!
ROBIN: Yes?
ARTHUR: Brave Sir Robin, you go.
ROBIN: Hey!  I've got a great idea.  Why doesn't Launcelot go?
LAUNCELOT: Yes.  Let me go, my liege.  I will take him single-handed.  I shall make a feint to the north-east that s--
ARTHUR: No, no.  No.  Hang on!  Hang on!  Hang on!  Just answer the five questions--
GALAHAD: Three questions.
ARTHUR: Three questions as best you can.  And we shall watch...  and pray.
LAUNCELOT: I understand, my liege.
ARTHUR: Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot.  God be with you.
BRIDGEKEEPER: Stop!  Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see.
LAUNCELOT: Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
BRIDGEKEEPER: What is your name?
LAUNCELOT: My name is Sir Launcelot of Camelot.
BRIDGEKEEPER: What is your quest?
LAUNCELOT: To seek the Holy Grail.
BRIDGEKEEPER: What is your favorite color?
LAUNCELOT: Blue.
BRIDGEKEEPER: Right.  Off you go.
LAUNCELOT: Oh, thank you.  Thank you very much.
ROBIN: That's easy!
BRIDGEKEEPER: Stop!  Who approacheth the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see.
ROBIN: Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.  I'm not afraid.
BRIDGEKEEPER: What is your name?
ROBIN: Sir Robin of Camelot.
BRIDGEKEEPER: What is your quest?
ROBIN: To seek the Holy Grail.
BRIDGEKEEPER: What is the capital of Assyria?
ROBIN: I don't know that!  Auuuuuuuugh!
BRIDGEKEEPER: Stop!  What is your name?
GALAHAD: Sir Galahad of Camelot.
BRIDGEKEEPER: What is your quest?
GALAHAD: I seek the Grail.
BRIDGEKEEPER: What is your favorite color?
GALAHAD: Blue.  No yel-- auuuuuuuugh!
BRIDGEKEEPER: Hee hee heh.  Stop!  What is your name?
ARTHUR: It is Arthur, King of the Britons.
BRIDGEKEEPER: What is your quest?
ARTHUR: To seek the Holy Grail.
BRIDGEKEEPER: What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?
ARTHUR: What do you mean?  An African or European swallow?
BRIDGEKEEPER: Huh?  I-- I don't know that!  Auuuuuuuugh!
BEDEVERE: How do know so much about swallows?
ARTHUR: Well, you have to know these things when you're a king, you know. [suspenseful music] [music suddenly stops] [intermission] [suspenseful music resumes]
SCENE 24:
ARTHUR: Launcelot!  Launcelot!  Launcelot!
BEDEVERE: Launcelot!  Launcelot!
ARTHUR: Launcelot! [police radio] Launcelot!
BEDEVERE: Launcelot!  Launcelot! [angels sing] [singing stops] [ethereal music] 
ARTHUR: The Castle Aaagh.  Our quest is at an end!  God be praised!  Almighty God, we thank Thee that Thou hast vouchsafed to us the most holy-- [twong] [baaaa] Jesus Christ! [thud] 
FRENCH GUARD: Allo, dappy English k-niggets and Monsieur Arthur King, who has the brain of a duck, you know.  So, we French fellows outwit you a second time!
ARTHUR: How dare you profane this place with your presence!  I command you, in the name of the Knights of Camelot, to open the doors of this sacred castle, to which God Himself has guided us!
FRENCH GUARD: How you English say, 'I one more time, mac, unclog my nose in your direction', sons of a window-dresser!  So, you think you could out-clever us French folk with your silly knees-bent running about advancing behaviour?!  I wave my private parts at your aunties, you cheesy lot of second hand electric donkey-bottom biters.
ARTHUR: In the name of the Lord, we demand entrance to this sacred castle!
FRENCH GUARD: No chance, English bed-wetting types.  I burst my pimples at you and call your door-opening request a silly thing, you tiny-brained wipers of other people's bottoms!
ARTHUR: If you do not open this door, we shall take this castle by force! [splat] In the name of God and the glory of our-- [splat] 
FRENCH GUARDS: [laughing] 
ARTHUR: Agh.  Right!  That settles it!
FRENCH GUARD: Yes, depart a lot at this time, and cut the approaching any more or we fire arrows at the tops of your heads and make castanets out of your testicles already!  Ha ha haaa ha!
ARTHUR: Walk away.  Just ignore them.
FRENCH GUARD: And now, remain gone, illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!  And, if you think you got a nasty taunting this time, you ain't heard nothing yet, dappy English k-nnniggets!  Thpppt!
FRENCH GUARDS: [taunting] 
ARTHUR: We shall attack at once!
BEDEVERE: Yes, my liege!
ARTHUR: Stand by for attack! [exciting music] [music stops] [silence] French persons!
FRENCH GUARDS: [taunting] ... Dappy! ...
ARTHUR: Today the blood of many a valiant knight shall be avenged.  In the name of God, ...
FRENCH GUARDS: Hoo hoo!  Ohh, ha ha ha ha ha! ...
ARTHUR: ... we shall not stop our fight 'til each one of you lies dead, and the Holy Grail returns to those whom God has chosen!
FRENCH GUARDS: ... Ha ha ha! ...
ARTHUR: Charge!
ARMY OF KNIGHTS: Hooray! [police siren] 
HISTORIAN'S WIFE: Yes.  They're the ones.  I'm sure.
INSPECTOR: Come on.  Anybody armed must go too.
OFFICER #1: All right.  Come on.  Back.
HISTORIAN'S WIFE: Get that one.
OFFICER #1: Back.  Right away.  Just...  pull it off.  Come on.  Come along.
INSPECTOR: Put this man in the van.
OFFICER #1: Clear off.  Come on.
BEDEVERE: With whom?
INSPECTOR: Which one?
OFFICER #1: Oh-- this one.
INSPECTOR: Come on.  Put him in the van.
OFFICER #2: Get a blanket.
OFFICER #1: We have no hospital.
RANDOM: Ahh. [squeak] 
RANDOM: Ooh.
OFFICER #1: Come on.  Back.  Riiight back.  Come on!
OFFICER #2: Run along!  Run along!
OFFICER #1: Pull that off.  My, that's an offensive weapon, that is.
OFFICER #2: Come on.  Back with 'em.  Back.  Right.  Come along.
INSPECTOR: Everything? [squeak] 
OFFICER #1: All right, sonny.  That's enough.  Just pack that in. [crash] 
CAMERAMAN: Christ!

PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST, by Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio
[view looking straight down at rolling swells, sound of wind and thunder, then a low heartbeat]
Scene: PORT ROYAL
[teacups on a table in the rain]
[sheet music on music stands in the rain]
[bouquet of white orchids, Elizabeth sitting in the rain holding the bouquet]
[men rowing, men on horseback, to the sound of thunder]
[EITC logo on flag blowing in the wind]
[many rowboats are entering the harbor]
[Elizabeth sitting alone, at a distance]
[marines running, kick a door in] 
[a mule is seen on the left in the barn where the marines enter]
[Liz looking over her shoulder]
[Elizabeth drops her bouquet]
[Will is in manacles, being escorted by red coats]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will...!
[Elizabeth runs to Will]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Why is this happening? 
WILL TURNER: I don't know. You look beautiful.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I think it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
[marines cross their long axes to bar Governor from entering]
[Beckett, in white hair and curls, is standing with Mercer]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been too long.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: His Lord now... actually.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: In fact, I *do*. Mister Mercer! The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake. Arrest her.
ELIZABETH SWANN: On what charges?
WILL TURNER: No!
[Beckett takes another document from Mercer, who is standing with Beckett, craggy face and pony tail]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Ah-ha! Here's the one for William Turner. And I have another one for a Mister James Norrington. Is he present?
ELIZABETH SWANN: *What are the charges?*
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I don't believe that's the answer to the question I asked.
WILL TURNER: Lord Beckett! In the category of questions *not* answered...
ELIZABETH SWANN: We are under the jurisdiction of the King's governor of Port Royal, and you will tell us what we are charged with. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: For which the punishment, regrettably, is *also* death. Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.
ELIZABETH SWANN: *Captain* Jack Sparrow.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought you might.
Scene: BLACK PEARL
[views of rigging ropes and blocks aboard a ship at night] 
[Gibbs walks the deck alone at night, singing and drinking from a bottle]
GIBBS: Fifteen men on a dead man's chest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Drink and the devil had done for the rest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! 
[a bell tolls, Gibbs is interrupted from his drinking by the sound]
[Gibbs looks up to see a flock of crows flying in the foggy night sky]
Scene: TURKISH PRISON
[tolling of bells, camera pans to show the crows flying toward a coastal island] 
[pinnacle-like island off the coast at night, connected to the mainland by thin, lighted bridge]
[cages with men inside line the bridge]
[prisoners are being marched across the bridge]
[a male prisoner with bloody legs is muttering, and is dragged across the bridge by guards]
[a crow is seen reflected in the eye of one male prisoner in a cage, the crow attacks and pecks his eye out, he screams]
[the prisoner who was being dragged is taken down a hatch-like door in the ground, he also screams]
[rocky shoreline, lit with torches]
[men toss caskets into the sea]
[numerous caskets are floating out to sea, vertical streaks in the distant clouds are seen]
[a crow lands on one casket, begins pecking at the top] 
[sudden gunblast from inside the casket blows the crow away, along with much wood]
[hand holding flintlock pistol emerges, pans about, points it at audience for a moment]
[Jack breaks out of the top of the casket, puts his captain's hat on]
JACK SPARROW: Sorry, mate.
[Jack breaks the skeleton's leg off]
JACK SPARROW: Mind if we make a little side trip? I didn't think so.
[Jack uses the skeleton leg as an oar, rows toward the full moon and a waiting ship in the distance to the right of the moon]
Scene: BLACK PEARL
[Jack arrives at the Black Pearl in his coffin rowboat]
[Gibbs holds out his hand to help Jack aboard, Jack puts the skeleton leg in Gibbs' hand]
[Cotton drapes a coat onto Jack's back]
GIBBS: Not *quite* according to plan.
JACK SPARROW: Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.
GIBBS: You got what you went in for, then?
JACK SPARROW: Mm-hmm!
GIBBS: Captain, I think the crew, meaning me as well, were expecting something a bit more... *shiny*. What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed by the sea, and the treasure with it. 
LEECH: And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the Atlantic. 
MARTY: And the hurricane! Aye.
CREW: Aye. Aye.
GIBBS: All in all, it's seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating.
JACK SPARROW: Shiny?
GIBBS: Aye, shiny.
JACK SPARROW: Is that how you're all feeling, then? Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain?
COTTON'S PARROT: Awk! Walk the plank! 
[Jack grabs his pistol and points it at the bird]
JACK SPARROW: What did the bird say?
LEECH: Do not blame the bird. Show us what is on that piece of cloth there. 
[the monkey snarls, seizes the cloth, scampers off with it]
JACK SPARROW: Ohhh!
[Jack attempts to shoot the monkey with his pistol, his pistol misfires]
[Jack grabs a pistol from another crewman and blasts the monkey while it's on the deck]
[the monkey drops the cloth, but is unharmed, and scurries into the rigging]
GIBBS: Know that don't do no good. 
JACK SPARROW: It does me.
[Marty picks up the cloth that the monkey dropped]
MARTY: It's a key!
JACK SPARROW: No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key. 
[Jack holds up the cloth, the crew crowd forward]
[Among the crew: Chinese man, black man with a black beard, white bearded man with large black hat]
JACK SPARROW: Gentlemen, what do keys do?
LEECH: Keys... unlock... *things*? 
GIBBS: And whatever this key unlocks, *inside* there's something valuable. So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!
JACK SPARROW: No! If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?
GIBBS: So - We're going after this key!
JACK SPARROW: You're not making any sense at all. Any more questions?
MARTY: So... Do we have a heading?
JACK SPARROW: Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm... a general... in *that* way - direction. 
GIBBS: Cap'n? 
JACK SPARROW: Come on, snap to and make sail, you know how this works. Come on, oy/quick, oy/quick, hey!
[Marty and Gibbs gather alone by the railing]
MARTY: Have you noticed lately... The captain seems to be actin' a bit strange... -er.

Scene: PORT ROYAL: EITC HEADQUARTERS
[a painter is painting a detail on a mural of a world map]
[a guard brings Will in manacles into Beckett's office]
GUARD: Lord Beckett. The prisoner as ordered, Sir. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Those won't be necessary.
[Will's manacles are removed]
[Beckett pours some liquor] 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: The East India Trading Company has need of your services. We wish for you to act as our agent in a business transaction with our mutual friend: Captain Sparrow.
WILL TURNER: More acquaintance than friend. How do you know him?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: We've had dealings in the past. And we've each left our mark... on the other. 
WILL TURNER: What mark did he leave on you? 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: By your efforts Jack Sparrow was set free. I would like you to go to him, and recover a certain property in his possession.
WILL TURNER: Recover. At the point of a sword?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: *Bargain*!
[Beckett goes over to a wooden box on a table and opens it]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Letters of Marque. You will offer what amounts to a full pardon. Jack will be free, a privateer in the employ of England.
WILL TURNER: Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment the same as being free.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Freedom. Jack Sparrow is a dying breed. The world is shrinking, the blank pages of the map filled in. Jack must find his place in the new world or perish. Not unlike you, Mister Turner. You and your fianc\E9e face the hangman's noose. 
WILL TURNER: So you get both Jack *and* the Black Pearl.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: The Black Pearl?
WILL TURNER: The property you want that he possesses.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: A ship? Hardly. The item in question's considerably smaller and far more valuable. Something Sparrow keeps on his person at all times. A compass. Ah, you know it. Bring back that Compass, or there's no deal.

[Jack walks over to see who spoke]
JACK SPARROW: Bootstrap. Bill Turner.

JACK SPARROW: Is this a dream?
JACK SPARROW: I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.
[Bootstrap immediately hands Jack a bottle of rum]
[Jack pries the bottle from Bootstrap's hand with a crackling sound]
JACK SPARROW: I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way.
[Jack tinks the lip of the bottle with his fingers, then blows across the top of the bottle]
JACK SPARROW: Your son.
[Jack takes a drink from the bottle]
JACK SPARROW: And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle? 
JACK SPARROW: Who?
JACK SPARROW: Ah. So it's you, then. He shanghaied you into service, eh? 
[a small hermit crab scuttles by Bootstrap, on top of the barrel where Bootstrap sits]
[Bootstrap grabs the hermit crab, pops it into his mouth, and crunches on it]
[Jack moves his mouth, jaw, and tongue around in revulsion while watching]
[Jack hands the bottle back to Bootstrap]
JACK SPARROW: It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment -
[Jack starts to walk off, but Bootstrap stands up at the same time and intercepts Jack, blocking him]
JACK SPARROW: Technic -
JACK SPARROW: Yes, but the Flying Dutchman already *has* a captain, so there's re -
JACK SPARROW: Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie? 
[Jack looks at the palm of his left hand, where a black spot boils into view]
[Jack looks up, but Bootstrap has disappeared]
Scene: BLACK PEARL: ON DECK

GIBBS: Do we have a heading?
JACK SPARROW: Ah! Ooh! Run! Land.

WILL TURNER: Does it matter? I'm to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal. In exchange the charges against us will be dropped.
WILL TURNER: Is that lack of faith in Jack, or in me?
ELIZABETH SWANN: I have faith in you. Both of you. Where will you find him? 
WILL TURNER: Tortuga. I'll start there, and I won't stop searching 'til I find him. And then I intend to return here, to marry you. 
ELIZABETH SWANN: Properly? 
WILL TURNER: Eagerly, if you'll still have me.
ELIZABETH SWANN: If it weren't for these bars I'd have you already.

[Elizabeth slips into the dark room from an interior door, hands held behind her]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Then what is?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I'm afraid that *currency* is the currency of the realm.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding. I'm here to negotiate.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I'm listening.
[Elizabeth pulls a pistol, points it at Beckett's head]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I'm listening *intently*.
ELIZABETH SWANN: These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Yes, and they're not valid until they bear my signature and my seal.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Or else I would not still be here. You sent Will to get you the Compass owned by Jack Sparrow. It will do you no good. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Do explain.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself. There is something you need to know.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Ah, I see. *You* think the Compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta, and so you hope to *save* me from an evil fate. But you mustn't worry. I care not for cursed Aztec gold. My desires are not so provincial. There's more than one chest of value in these waters. So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer. 
[Elizabeth cocks her pistol]
[Beckett signs the document]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: So I did. A marriage interrupted. Or fate intervenes. You make great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom. 
ELIZABETH SWANN: These aren't going to Jack.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Oh really. To ensure Mister Turner's freedom, then? I'll still want that Compass. Consider that in your calculations. Longboat
[Ragetti appears to be reading a Bible in the back of the longboat, but the Bible is upside-down]

[the dog goes to the bow, looking forward, keys in its mouth] 
RAGETTI: ?: Well how'dya know it weren't/wasn't divine providence what inspired you to *be* clever? Anyways, I ain't stealin' no ship. 
PINTEL: It ain't stealin'. It's *salvagin'*! And since when did you care? 
RAGETTI: Since we're not immortal no more. We gotta take care of our immortal souls. 
PINTEL: You know you can't read.
RAGETTI: It's the Bible. You get credit for trying. 
PINTEL: Pretendin' to read the Bible's a *lie*! *That's* a mark against ya! Look! There it is!

WILL TURNER: Why would he do this to us? If Jack is their chief.
GIBBS: Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their chief. But he only remains chief as long as he *acts* like a chief. 
WILL TURNER: So he had no choice. He's a captive then as much as the rest of us.
GIBBS: Worse... as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a *god* in human form, and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison.
[Cotton bites Gibbs' fingers to illustrate]
GIBBS: Argh! They'll roast him and eat him.
WILL TURNER: Where's the rest of the crew?
GIBBS: These cages we're in... weren't built 'til *after* we got here.
[Will was gripping the bars made of human bones, but quickly pulls his hand away]

CANNIBAL CROWD: Hay ala! Ala, ala!

RAGETTI: He's got me eye! He won't give it back!
PINTEL: Well, how'd you get it back last time?
GIBBS: Excellent work! Work's half done!
PINTEL: We done it for you! Knowin' you'd be comin' back for us.

JACK SPARROW: William... I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me... to find *this*. 
WILL TURNER: You want me to find this?
JACK SPARROW: No. *You* want you to find this. Because the finding this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating and your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly/dotty belle ol'... what's-her-face. Savvy? 
WILL TURNER: This... is going to save Elizabeth?
JACK SPARROW: How much do you know about Davy Jones?
WILL TURNER: Not much.

BURSAR: It's not like that, Sir. This ship is haunted. 
BELLAMY: Is it now? 'N' you? 
QUARTERMASTER: The... female presence... amongst us, yes... all the men... they can feel it. The ghost of a lady, widowed before her marriage, I figure it. Searching for her husband, lost at sea. A virgin, too, likely as not. And that bodes ill by all accounts.
BURSAR: I say... that we throw the dress overboard, and we hope the spirit finds it. 
QUARTERMASTER: No! That - that will just anger the spirit, Sir. What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then just get it back! 
BELLAMY: Enough! Enough! You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you. Now this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway aboard. A young woman, by the look of it. I want you to search the ship and find 'er. Oh, and uh... she's probably naked. 
[the crew enthusiastically rushes off in search of the stowaway] Pantano River
[aerial view of the mouth of the Pantano River, two longboats are beginning their way up the river]
[the longboats are in a swampy area with twisted roots]
WILL TURNER: Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?
GIBBS: Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones. A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off. And drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness. The Kraken!
[Marty turns around at mention of the word, Pintel and Ragetti look at each other]
GIBBS: They say the stench of its breath is like - ooh! Imagine: The last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the Kraken, and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses. If you believe such things. 
WILL TURNER: And the key will spare him that?
GIBBS: Now that's the very question Jack wants answered. Bad enough even to go visit... *Her*.
WILL TURNER: Her?
GIBBS: Aye.
BAYOU: Tia's shack
[bayou with fireflies, and an iguana on a tree trunk on the left]
[the iguana eats a firefly with a quick slurping sound]
[people are occasionally seen standing quietly in the darkness among the trees]
JACK SPARROW: No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go way back. Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable we are. Were. Have been. Before. 
GIBBS: I'll watch your back.
JACK SPARROW: It's me front I'm worried about. Mind the boat.
GIBBS: Mind the boat.
WILL TURNER: Mind the boat.
PINTEL: Mind the boat.
MARTY: Mind the boat.
COTTON'S PARROT: Awk! Mind the boat! 
[Cotton is left alone in the longboat]
[Jack cautiously enter's Tia's shack, pushing the door open slowly]
[near the inside of the shack door hangs a live snake, moving slowly] 
[Tia is sitting at a table, looks up from her crab claws, sees Jack in the doorway]
TIA DALMA: Jack Sparrow! 
JACK SPARROW: Tia Dalma!
TIA DALMA: I always know de wind was goin' blow you back to me one day. 
[Tia sees Will standing in the doorway, goes up to him]
TIA DALMA: You. You have a touch of... destiny about *you*, William Turner.
WILL TURNER: You know me?
TIA DALMA: You want to know *me*.
JACK SPARROW: There'll be no knowing here. We've come for help and we're not leaving without it.
JACK SPARROW: I thought *I* knew you.
TIA DALMA: Not so well as I had hoped. Come.
JACK SPARROW: Come.
TIA DALMA: What... service... may I do you? Hmmm? You know I demand payment.
JACK SPARROW: I brought payment.
[Jack whistles once, a crewmember brings in the monkey in a cage]
JACK SPARROW: Look!
[Jack cocks his pistol, shoots the monkey, the bullet has no effect, but the monkey chatters in fright]
JACK SPARROW: An undead monkey! Top that!
[Tia lifts the cage door, the monkey scampers off]
GIBBS: No! You've no idea how long it took us to catch that. 
TIA DALMA: The payment is fair.
JACK SPARROW: We're looking for this. And what it goes to.
TIA DALMA: The Compass you bartered from me. It cannot lead you to dis? 
JACK SPARROW: Maybe. Why?
TIA DALMA: Ayeee... Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants! Or... do know, but are loathe to claim it as your own. Your key go to a chest, and it is what lay inside the chest you seek, don't it? 
GIBBS: What *is* inside?
PINTEL: Gold! Jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature? 
RAGETTI: Nothing... bad, I hope.
[a jar of eyeballs is hanging next to Ragetti's face as he speaks] 
TIA DALMA: You know of... Davy Jones, yes? A man of de sea. A great sailor, until he ran afoul of dat which vex all men.
WILL TURNER: What vexes all men?
TIA DALMA: What, indeed.
GIBBS: The sea?
PINTEL: Sums!
RAGETTI: Dichotomy of good and evil.
JACK SPARROW: A *woman*.
TIA DALMA: A wo-*man*. He fell in love.
GIBBS: No-no-no-no, I heard it was the *sea* he fell in love with.
TIA DALMA: Same story, different versions, and all are true. See, it was a *woman*, as changing, and harsh, and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it cause 'im was too much to live wid. But not enough to cause him to die.
WILL TURNER: What... exactly did he put into the chest?
TIA DALMA: Him heart.
RAGETTI: Literally, or figuratively?
PINTEL: He couldn't li'erally put his heart in a chest! Could he?
TIA DALMA: It was not wort' feeling what... small fleeting joy life brings, and so... he carved out him heart, lock it away in a chest, and hide de chest from de world. De keys, he keep wid him at all times.
WILL TURNER: You knew this.
JACK SPARROW: I did not. I didn't know where the key was. But now we do. So all that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, hey!
TIA DALMA: Let me see your hand.
[Jack shows his right hand is untouched, but Tia unwraps the bandage on his left hand]
[the black spot on Jack's left hand is revealed]
GIBBS: Uhhh! The black spot!
[Gibbs quickly wipes his hands on his chest, spins around once to the left, and spits] Black spot! Black spot!
[Pintel and Ragetti copy Gibbs' ritual, in synchrony]
JACK SPARROW: My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know. 
[pushing aside cloth door beads, Tia goes into a back room, and searches for something]
TIA DALMA: I am justMy little ###, where are you? ###
[Jack steals a ring off of one of Tia's tables, beside the ring is a silver locket] 
[Tia comes back with an object from the back room]
TIA DALMA: Davy Jones cannot make port. Cannot step on land but once every ten years. Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow. And so you will carry land wid you... 
[Tia hands Jack a jar of dirt]
JACK SPARROW: Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.
TIA DALMA: Yes?
JACK SPARROW: Is the... jar of dirt going to help?
TIA DALMA: If you don' want it, give it back.
JACK SPARROW: No. 
TIA DALMA: Den it helps.
WILL TURNER: It seems... we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.
[Tia is sitting, she holds several crab shells between her cupped hands and closes her eyes]
TIA DALMA: A touch... of destiny!
[Tia throws the crab claws down on the table to see how they fall] 
[fade to aerial view of rocky islands whose positions match the positions of the crab claws] Black Pearl
[pan beyond the rocks to the Black Pearl just offshore, in stormy weather]
[the Black Pearl crew look at the scuttled ship on the rocks]
WILL TURNER: That's the Flying Dutchman? She doesn't look like much.
JACK SPARROW: Neither do you. Do *not* underestimate her.
[Jack gives Gibbs a meaningful glance, elbows Gibbs]
GIBBS: Must've run afoul of the reef.
JACK SPARROW: So what's your plan, then?
WILL TURNER: I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key. 
JACK SPARROW: And if there are crewmen?
WILL TURNER: I cut down anyone in my path.
JACK SPARROW: I like it. Simple, easy to remember.
RAGETTI: Your chariot awaits you, sire! Ha, ha-ha-ha, ha-ha!
JACK SPARROW: Hey! If you *do* happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt! Might save your life!
RAGETTI: Bon voyage! Ha-ha-ha!
JACK SPARROW: Douse the lamps.
[Marty douses a lamp, then Cotton douses a lamp, then Pintel douses a lamp]
[Will sets off in a rowboat, alone, toward the scuttled ship]
SCUTTLED SHIP: before attack
[Will goes aboard the ship, lantern in hand]
[Will passes one dead crewman at deck level, proped up behind net-like rigging]
[Will comes across a wounded sailor, who seems to be in shock]
[the wounded sailor is pulling on a pulley desperately, muttering to himself]
WOUNDED SAILOR: ...up the...
WILL TURNER: Sailor!
WOUNDED SAILOR: ...the stench...capsized...
WILL TURNER: Sailor!
WOUNDED SAILOR: ...bring a...
WILL TURNER: There's no use. You've run aground.
WOUNDED SAILOR: No! Beneath us! Foul breath!
[behind Will, a crewmember's body falls from a height, splashing into the water]
[Will goes to investigate]
WILL TURNER: Hey! Hey!
[Will turns the man's body over to see his face]
[the man's face is gone, his face is just a puckered piece of skin, which bulges outward]
[the real Flying Dutchman suddenly rises from the sea, nearby the scuttled ship]
[the sea creature-like crew emerge from the surfaces of the Flying Dutchman]
[crewmembers from the Flying Dutchman attack the remaining crew of the scuttled ship]
GREENBEARD: Down on your marrowbones, and pray. 
[Will engages in a swordfight against several invaders]
[Will dips his sword in oil, causing it to flame, and waves it at the men surrounding him]
WILL TURNER: Get back! Back!
[Will slices open the stomach of one of the invaders, fish spill out of it onto the deck]
[Will battles the invading crewmembers, but one of them knocks Will unconscious] Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
SCUTTLED SHIP: after attack
[the prisoners of the scuttled ship cower in fear, lined up, sitting in a row on deck along the railing]
[Jack is at the end of the row of five survivors total, on the right-side when facing the survivors]
[Davy Jones stomps aboard with his peg leg, underwater view of his departing feet]
[Maccus is on deck, turned so that his back is shown, showing lobster legs on his back]
MACCUS: Five men still alive. The rest have moved on. 
[Jones pauses to clench his left hand, which is a large lobster claw]
[Jones casually lights a pipe in front of one of the cowering crewmen]
DAVY JONES: Do you fear death? Do you fear that dark abyss? All your deeds laid bare. All your sins punished. I can offer you... an escape-uh.
CHAPLAIN: Don't listen to him! 
[Jones walks over to the chaplain, takes the chaplain's head in his claw]
DAVY JONES: Do you not fear death? 
CHAPLAIN: I'll take my chances, Sir.
DAVY JONES: To the depths.
[the chaplain's throat is slit, two crewmembers throw his body overboard] Ah, ha-ha-ha...!
[unidentified crewman] Cold blooded - !
DAVY JONES: Life is cruel. Why should the afterlife be any *different*? I offer you a choice. Join my crew, and postpone the judgment. One hundred years before the mast. Will ye serve?
HELMSMAN: I - I will, serve. 
DAVY JONES: Grand. 
[Jones looks pleased, then sees Will at the end of the line of people]
[Jones stomps over to Will]
DAVY JONES: *You* are neither dead nor dying. What is your purpose here?
WILL TURNER: Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.
DAVY JONES: What is your purpose here?
WILL TURNER: Jack Sparrow. He sent me to settle his debt.
DAVY JONES: Huh! Did he, now? I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer. 
[through a spyglass, Jack sees Jones turn to look directly at him] Black Pearl
[suddenly Jones is standing aboard the Black Pearl, directly in front of Jack and his spyglass]
[Cotton and Gibbs have knives to their throats from other Flying Dutchman crewmembers who teleported over]
JACK SPARROW: Oh.
DAVY JONES: You have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. *That* was our agreement.
JACK SPARROW: Technically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.
DAVY JONES: Then you were a poor captain, but a *captain* nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as *Captain* Jack Sparrow? 
JACK SPARROW: You have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.
DAVY JONES: One soul is not equal to another.
JACK SPARROW: Aha! So we've established my proposal is sound in principle, now we're just haggling over price. 
DAVY JONES: Price? Pttt!
JACK SPARROW: Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth?
DAVY JONES: One hundred souls, three days-uh.
JACK SPARROW: You're a diamond, mate. Send me back the boy, I'll get started right off. 
[Maccus blocks Jack from exiting]
DAVY JONES: I keep the boy. A good-faith payment. That leaves you only ninety-nine more to go. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! 
JACK SPARROW: Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic, *terrific* soprano. Worth at least four... maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him... would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony. Aye?
DAVY JONES: I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh. But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of servitude, in your name while you roam free?
JACK SPARROW: Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal it in blood? I mean... mm-mm - ink?
[Jones grabs Jack's hand, resulting in a squishy sound]
JACK SPARROW: Uh!
DAVY JONES: Three days. Three days.
[Pintel whimpers, with a knife held to his neck from a crewmember of Jones' ship]
[Jack looks at his hand, it's covered with slime, but the black spot disappears under the effect of the slime]
JACK SPARROW: Oh, Mr. Gibbs.
GIBBS: Aye.
JACK SPARROW: Uh, I feel sullied and unusual. 
GIBBS: And how do you intend to harvest these ninety-nine souls in three days?
JACK SPARROW: Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be.
GIBBS: Ah... Tortuga!
JACK SPARROW: Tortuga.
Scene: Edinburgh Trader
[inside a cabin aboard the Edinburgh Trader, Captain Bellamy is throwing documents down on the table]
BELLAMY: It's an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing fees, *wharf* handling, and heaven help us, pilotage. Are we all to work for the East India Trading Company, then? 
QUARTERMASTER: I'm afraid, Sir... Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters.
BELLAMY: A *pirate* port is what you mean. Well, I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep well each night, thank you.
[a white dress floats by the cabin window, outside]
BURSAR: S-S-Sir!
[they all rush to the window of the cabin and look out]
[they all see the dress float by the cabin window, on its second pass]
[one crewman gasps]
[the men go outside to see the dress that was floating by the window]
[the dress floats like a ghost, its left arm raised as if pointing]
BURSAR: She wants you to... do something. 
BELLAMY: She's tryna give a sign. 
[the dress sweeps over a lantern, knocking it over and part of the deck ignites]
BELLAMY: Over there! Look for a sign! 
[the crew rush to the railing and look out at the sea]
[Elizabeth, up on the mast overhead, sighs in exasperation]
QUARTERMASTER: Look there! There it is. There's the sign.
BURSAR: That's seaweed. 
QUARTERMASTER: S-Seaweed can be a sign.
BURSAR: Looks like entrails.  That would be a bad sign.
ELIZABETH SWANN: What's that over there?
[Elizabeth is now sitting on a platform on the deck behind the men, pointing at the deck where the lantern fell]
[the men at the railing turn around and look where Elizabeth is pointing]
[the fire burning on the desk spells out "Tortuga" in fiery letters] Tortuga
[men are tied up with ropes alongside a well, camera pans past the well]
[a man is tied up and being dunked in the well, and is spouting water from his mouth]
[crowded tavern, glass bottles are being shot off of people's heads for entertainment]
[a duo of musicians is playing a guitar and accordion]
GIBBS: And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?
ELDERLY MAN: Truth be told, I never sailed a day in me life. I figure I should get out and see the world while I'm still young.
GIBBS: You'll do. Make your mark. Next!
JILTED MAN: My wife ran off with my dog. And I'm drunk for a month. And I don't give a ass rat's if I live or die.
GIBBS: Perfect! Next!
ONE-ARMED MAN: Me have one arm, 'n' a bum leg. 
GIBBS: It's the crow's nest for you.
[Jack is sitting alongside a wall, within earshot of Gibbs' table, trying to make his Compass work]
JACK SPARROW: I know what I want.
GIBBS: Next!
ROMANTIC MAN: Ever since I was a little lad, I've always wanted to sail the seas. Forever.
GIBBS: Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.
ROMANTIC MAN: Thanks very much.
JACK SPARROW: How we going?
GIBBS: Including those four? That gives us - four!
[to the next candidate in line]
GIBBS: And what's *your* story?
NORRINGTON: My story... it's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind. I chased a man across the Seven Seas. The pursuit cost me my crew, my commission, and my life. 
GIBBS: Commodore?
NORRINGTON: No, not anymore, weren't you *listening*? I nearly had you all, off Tripoli. I would have, if not for the... hurricane. 
GIBBS: Lord. You didn't try to sail through it?
NORRINGTON: So do I make your crew, or not? You haven't said where you're going. Somewhere *nice*! 
[unidentified woman] Oh!
[the music stops, everyone stares at the altercation]
[Jack grabs a branch from a vase, carries it in front of his face, attempts to walk out unseen] 
NORRINGTON: So am I *worthy* to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow?
[Norrington spots Jack sneaking off behind him, points a pistol at Jack]
NORRINGTON: Or should I just kill you now?
[Jack ducks back and forth behind both sides of a large post, as Norrington points his pistol at Jack]
JACK SPARROW: You're hired.
NORRINGTON: Sorry. Old habits and all that.
[unidentifed man, to Norrington] Easy, sonny!
[someone deflects Norrington's pistol upwards as it fires]
[the ball richochets off the chandelier, breaking a man's bottle as he's drinking from it]
[the man whose bottle broke slugs a man next to him]
[the music starts back up as a brawl ensues]
[one man swings from chandelier, women fight, bottles are thrown against the wall, etc.]
JACK SPARROW: Time to go?
GIBBS: Aye!
[a swordfight is going on]
[someone throws a bottle against the wall above the stairs, Jack ducks as it smashes above his head]
[Jack makes his way upstairs, trading hats a few times along the way]
JACK SPARROW: Thanks, mate.
[Jack slaps him on the shoulder, the man falls backwards off the balcony]
[Jack halts to let two men carrying another man proceed towards the edge of the balcony]
JACK SPARROW: Carry on. Heave!
[the two men throw the carried man off the balcony, then Jack continues on his way]
[the music stops, Norrington threateningly holds a bottle in his left hand]
NORRINGTON: Come on, men! Who wants some? Form an orderly line, I'll have you all one by one. Come on, who's first?
[from behind, Elizabeth grabs the bottle from Norrington, smashes it over his head, knocking him out]
ELIZABETH SWANN: I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself! 
[the crowd cheers, and everyone holds up their mugs in a toast]
[men throw Norrington into the mud with some pigs, the crowd leaves except for Elizabeth]
[Elizabeth turns Norrington over, onto his back]
ELIZABETH SWANN: James Norrington. What has the world done to you?
[Mercer observes Elizabeth and Norrington from the doorway of the tavern] Flying Dutchman
[Jones plays his pipe organ with his tentacles, steam coming from pipes]
[the crew are on desk, slaving away, pulling rhythmically on a rope] Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave!
BO'SUN: Secure the mast tackle, Mister Turner!
BO'SUN: Step to-it/tight!
[Will goes to grab a rope]
WILL TURNER: Step aside!
BO'SUN: Regain-yourselves!/Mind-yourself!
Scene: ###
[Bootstrap sees that the other man at the rope is his son, Bootstrap is stunned]
[Bootstrap lets go of the rope, Will attempts to grab the sliding rope]
[the cannon's rope drags Will across the deck]
[the hoisted cannon crashes to the deck, and the organ music stops]
BO'SUN: Haul that weevil to his feet! 
[the crew haul Will to his feet]
BO'SUN: Five lashes to remind you... to stay on 'em! 
BO'SUN: Impeding me in my duties. You'll share the punishment.
DAVY JONES: Will you now? And what would prompt such an act of charity?
DAVY JONES: Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! What fortuitous circumstance be this! Five lashes be owed. I believe it is.
[Jones hands the whip to Bootstrap, Jones' tentacle curls around the shaft of it]
DAVY JONES: The cat's out of the bag, Mister Turner. Your issue will feel its sting be it the Bo'sun's hand, by your own. 
DAVY JONES: Bo'sun!
[Bootstrap reluctantly takes the whip]
[two crewmen tear Will's shirt off, exposing his bare back]
[Bootstrap whips Will's back five times]
[Will is tossed into a lower part of the deck, partially filled with water]
[Will stands up, wearing an intact white shirt]
BO'SUN: You had it easy, boy! Ha ha ha!
WILL TURNER: I don't need your help!
WILL TURNER: So I'm to understand what *you* did was an act of compassion?
FLYING DUTCHMAN: below deck
[Bootstrap and Will enter the interior of the ship together]
[crewmember Wyvern is seen to their right, encrusted into the interior side of the hull, standing up]
WILL TURNER: I've sworn no oath.
WILL TURNER: Not until I find this. The key.
[Wyvern's eyes open in the coral-encrusted wall at the mention of the key]
[Wyvern, who is part of the wall, breaks his head away from the wall, leaving his brains behind]
WYVERN: The deadman's chest.
WILL TURNER: What do you know of this?
WYVERN: Open the chest with the key, and stab the heart. No-no-no-no. Don't stab the heart. The Dutchman needs a living heart, or there'll be no captain. And if there's no captain, there's no one to have the key. 
WILL TURNER: So the captain has the key.
[Wyvern retracts his head back into the wall, having said too much]
WILL TURNER: Where *is* the key?
WYVERN: Hidden.
WILL TURNER: Where is the chest?
WYVERN: Hidden.
[Wyvern closes his eyes, and falls silent]
Scene: Black Pearl
[the Black Pearl is at a dock, loading fruits and livestock]
[Jack and Gibbs are walking together, Elizabeth approaches from behind, still dressed as a man]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Captain Sparrow!
JACK SPARROW: Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I'm here to find the man I love.
JACK SPARROW: I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.
[Norrington vomits over the side] 
ELIZABETH SWANN: Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.
JACK SPARROW: Elizabeth. Hide the rum.
[Gibbs takes the bottle that Jack hands to him, and walks up the boarding plank in the background]
JACK SPARROW: You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack. I know Will came to find you. Where is he?
JACK SPARROW: Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but... through an unfortunate and *entirely* unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Davy Jones?
[Norrington vomits over the side, then spits]
NORRINGTON: Oh, please. The captain of the Flying Dutchman.
JACK SPARROW: You look bloody awful. What are you doing here?
NORRINGTON: You *hired* me. I can't help it if your standards are lax.
JACK SPARROW: You *smell* funny.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack. All I want is to find Will.
JACK SPARROW: Are you certain? Is that what you really want most?
ELIZABETH SWANN: 'Course.
JACK SPARROW: Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most.
ELIZABETH SWANN: And you have a way of doing that?
JACK SPARROW: Well, there is a chest...
NORRINGTON: Oh, dear.
JACK SPARROW: A chest of unknown size and origin.
[Pintel & Ragetti walk by, together carrying a crate of bottles, and overhearing the conversation]
PINTEL: What contains the still-beating heart o' Davy Jones.
RAGETTI: Unh-unh... unh-unh... unh-unh...
JACK SPARROW: And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including... saving brave William from his grim fate.
NORRINGTON: You don't actually believe him, do you?
ELIZABETH SWANN: How do we find it?
JACK SPARROW: With this. My Compass... is unique.
NORRINGTON: "Unique" here having the meaning of broken.
JACK SPARROW: True enough. This Compass does not point north.
[Norrington vomits over the side]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Where does it point?
JACK SPARROW: It points to the thing you want most in this world.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh Jack! Are you telling the truth?
JACK SPARROW: Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?
ELIZABETH SWANN: To save Will?
JACK SPARROW: By finding the chest of Davy Jones.
[Jack hands the compass to Elizabeth, then draws away quickly so as not to influence the compass]
[Elizabeth consults the compass, for her the dial clearly points in a specific direction]
[Jack slowly rises up to peer at the face of the compass]
JACK SPARROW: Mister Gibbs!
GIBBS: Cap'n.
JACK SPARROW: We have our heading.
GIBBS: Finally! Cast off those lines, weigh anchor, and prow that canvas!
JACK SPARROW: Miss Swann.
Scene: GIBBS###
PINTEL: Welcome to the crew, former Commodore! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh...
[the goat neighs]
PORT ROYAL: EITC headquarters
[Beckett and Mercer are in a room with the governor, whose hands are in shackles]
[Mercer is looking through a mounted telescope to outside the window]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: There's something to knowing the exact shape of the world and one's place in it, don't you agree?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I had you brought here because I thought you'd be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter.
MERCER: Most recently seen on the island of Tortuga, then left, in the company of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow. *And* other fugitives from justice.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Including the previous owner of this sword... I believe. Our ships are in pursuit. and justice will be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass, and all manner of remorseless pieces of metal. I personally find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Your authority as governor, your influence in London, and your loyalty to the East India Trading Company.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Shall I remove these shackles?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: So you see, Mercer, every man has a price he will willingly accept. Even for what he hopes never to sell.
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
[slow motion scene of falling dice]
[three crewman are playing Liar's Dice] 
[organ music is heard in the background]
MACCUS: I wager... ten years.
KOLENIKO: I'll match ten years.
GREENBEARD: Agreed.
WILL TURNER: I understand. Liar!
WILL TURNER: It's a game of deception. Your bet includes all the dice, not just your own.
WILL TURNER: What are they wagering?
WILL TURNER: So any crewman can be challenged?
WILL TURNER: I challenge Davy Jones.
[immediately the organ music ceases, immediately Jones' peg leg is heard thumping in approach]
[with each thump of his footstep, gooseneck barnacles retract]
[someone laughs]
DAVY JONES: I accept that-uh.
[Jones sits down at the gambling table]
DAVY JONES: The stakes?
WILL TURNER: My soul. An eternity of servitude.
DAVY JONES: Against?
WILL TURNER: I want this.
[Jack shows Jones the picture of the key]
DAVY JONES: How do you know of the key?
WILL TURNER: That's not part of the game, is it? You can still walk away.
[One of Jones' tentacles pulls out the key from his vest to display it]
[the tentacle puts the key back]
[Bootstrap sits down at the table]
DAVY JONES: What's this?
WILL TURNER: No! Don't do this.
DAVY JONES: Four fours.
WILL TURNER: Four fives.
DAVY JONES: Seven fives-uh.
WILL TURNER: Eight fives.
DAVY JONES: Huh huh huh. Welcome to the crew, liar. 
DAVY JONES: And be called a liar myself for my trouble? Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship! Master Turner, feel free to go ashore... the very next time we make port! 
WILL TURNER: Fool. Why did you do that?
WILL TURNER: It was never about winning, or losing.
FLYING DUTCHMAN: organ room
[nighttime on deck of the Flying Dutchman]
[Will emerges from a hatch on deck]
[Will sneaks past one one the crew on deck, who is sleeping with a bottle in his hand]
[Jones is asleep at his organ, snoring]
[Will sneaks into his room, behind him]
[Will grabs a nearby quill pen, uses it to lift one of Jones' tentacles]
[one tentacle accidentally falls on an organ key, almost waking up Jones]
[the falling tentacle also sets off a locket on top of the organ, that plays a song]
[Will holds one of the staves in his mouth while lifting the tentacles]
[Will finally removes the key, replaces it with his drawing of the key]
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
WILL TURNER: It's not a fate you had to choose for yourself, either.
WILL TURNER: They'll know you helped me.
WILL TURNER: I take this with a promise. I'll find a way to sever Jones' hold on you. And not rest until this blade pierces his heart. I will not abandon you. I promise.
[Will sets out alone on a longboat]
Scene: Black Pearl
[crewmen are scrubbing the deck of the Black Pearl]
GIBBS: Beckett!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Yes, they're signed, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company.
JACK SPARROW: Agh.
GIBBS: Will was working for Beckett, and never said a word.
JACK SPARROW: Agh.
GIBBS: Beckett wants the Compass. Only one reason for that.
JACK SPARROW: Of course. He wants the chest.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Yes, he did say something about a chest.
GIBBS: If the company controls the chest, they controls the sea.
JACK SPARROW: A truly discomforting notion, love.
GIBBS: And bad. Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate. I think there's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails. Brace the foreyard!
JACK SPARROW: Might I inquire how as to how you came by these? 
ELIZABETH SWANN: Persuasion.
JACK SPARROW: Friendly?
ELIZABETH SWANN: Decidedly not.
JACK SPARROW: Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price. 
[Jack tucks the Letters into his coat and begins to walk away]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack, the Letters, give them back.
JACK SPARROW: No. Persuade me.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You do know Will taught me how handle a sword. 
JACK SPARROW: As I said... Persuade me.
[Elizabeth walks away frustrated, leans on the ship's railing]
[Jack makes an odd grunting noise]
[Norrington walks up to Elizabeth at the railing]
NORRINGTON: It's a curious thing. There was a time when I would've given anything for you to look like that while thinking about me.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I don't know what you mean.
NORRINGTON: Oh, I think you do.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh, don't be absurd. I trust him, that's all.
NORRINGTON: So you never wondered how your *latest* fianc\E9 ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place? Edinburgh Trader
BELLAMY: Strange thing to come upon a longboat so far out in open waters. 
WILL TURNER: Just put as many leagues behind us as you can. As fast as you can.
BELLAMY: And what are we running from?
[Will sees Elizabeth's white wedding dress on a chair in the cabin]
WILL TURNER: That dress. Where did you get it?
BELLAMY: It was found aboard the ship. The crew it thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill fate.
WILL TURNER: That's foolish.
QUARTERMASTER: Oh, yes. Proceededly foolish.
BURSAR: It brought good fortune! The spirit told us... Put in at Tortuga. And we made a nice bit of profit there.
BELLAMY: Off the books, of course. 
WILL TURNER: I imagine... some of your crew may have jumped ship there.
BELLAMY: Why do you ask?
MESSENGER SAILOR: Captain, a ship's been spotted. 
BELLAMY: Colors?
MESSENGER SAILOR: She isn't flyin' any.
BELLAMY: Pirates!
WILL TURNER: Or worse.
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
[Jones is on deck, having found the cloth that Will swapped for the key]
[Bootstrap is held at knife point on board the Flying Dutchman]
[one crewman holds a sawfish sword as a restraining weapon in front of Bootstrap] 
DAVY JONES: You will watch this.
[crewmen are whipped, in order to turn a large screw that raises the Kraken summoning device]
DAVY JONES: Let no joyful voice be heard! Let no man look up at the sky with hope! And let this day be cursed by we who ready to wake... the *Kraken*!
[the Kraken calling device thumps heavily against the sea]
Scene: Edinburgh Trader
[crewmen on board the Edinburgh Trader rush to the railing, chattering, to see the Flying Dutchman]
[Will is on top of the mast]
WILL TURNER: I've doomed us all. It's the Flying Dutchman!
[a loud thumping sound resonates throughout the ship]
BURSAR: Oh, Mother Cary's chickens. What happened? 
QUARTERMASTER: Must've hit a reef.
[the crew look overboard, see bubbles rising up alongside the ship]
BELLAMY: Free the rudder! Hard to port, then hard to starboard! Clear the rudder! Hard to port!
[a Kraken tentacle silently seizes one crewman while other crewmembers have their backs turned]
[the Kraken tentacle surfaces in the distance, holding the crewman who was just seized, he screams] *Kraken!*
[crewman rings the ship's bell wildly]
Scene: ###
[music stops, slow motion scene, a huge tentacle rises high over the ship]
[the tentacle comes down on deck, breaking the ship in two, bouncing men off the deck]
[slow motion scene, men slide off of tilted deck]
[Will is flung underwater, sees the body of the Kraken in the distance underwater]
[Will surfaces, climbs aboard a floating board of ship debris]
[the Flying Dutchman comes near Will, Will slides off his board to swim towards the ship]
[view from the bow of the Flying Dutchman, looking at the floating debris, including a face-down corpse]
[Elizabeth's wedding dress is also debris, and floats on the surface of the sea]
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
MACCUS: The boy's not here. He must've been claimed by the sea.
DAVY JONES: *I* am the sea.
[Jones stomps over to Bootstrap]
DAVY JONES: You need time alone with your thoughts. What of the survivors?
DAVY JONES: There are no survivors.
[the remaining crewmen are simultanenously axed from behind]
[Will witnesses the axing, ducks behind a beam]
[Jones turns around, sensing Will, but sees nothing]
DAVY JONES: The chest is no longer safe. Chart a course to Isla Cruces. Get me there first, or there'll be the devil to pay. 
KOLENIKO: First?
DAVY JONES: Who sent that thieving charlatan onto my ship? Who told them of the key? Jack Sparrow.
[camera shows Will hitching a ride on the front of the Flying Dutchman, between the jaw formations]
[Elizabeth's wedding dress is shown underwater, sinking into the depths of the sea] Black Pearl
[Elizabeth is sitting on some steps on deck of the Black Pearl]
[Jack walks over to her, holding a bottle of rum]
JACK SPARROW: My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I just thought I'd be married by now. I'm so ready to be married. 
[Jack offers Elizabeth a drink from his bottle]
JACK SPARROW: You know... Lizzy... I *am*... captain of a ship. And *being* captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a... marriage. Right here. Right on this deck. Right... *now*! 
[Elizabeth recoils at Jack's breath on the word "now"]
ELIZABETH SWANN: No, thank you.
JACK SPARROW: Why not? We *are* very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh. Except for a sense of honor, and decency and-and a moral center. And personal hygiene.
[Jack smells his armpits]
JACK SPARROW: Trifles. You *will* come over to my side, I know it.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You seem very certain.
JACK SPARROW: One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Why doesn't your Compass work? 
JACK SPARROW: Uh my Compass works fine. 
ELIZABETH SWANN: Because you and I *are* alike, and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it. To do the right thing.
JACK SPARROW: I *love* those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You'll have the chance to do something... something courageous. And when you do, you'll discover something: that you're a good man.
JACK SPARROW: All evidence to the contrary.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I have faith in you. Want to know why?
JACK SPARROW: Do tell, dearie.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Curiosity. You're going to want it. A chance to be admired. And gain the rewards that follow. You won't be able to resist. You're going to want to know... what it tastes like.
JACK SPARROW: I *do* want to know what it tastes like.
ELIZABETH SWANN: But - seeing as you're a good man I know you will *never* put me in a position that would compromise my honor.
[Jack stares in horror as the black spot boils back into view on his hand, Elizabeth doesn't notice]
ELIZABETH SWANN: I'm proud of you, Jack.
GIBBS: Land ho!
JACK SPARROW: I want my jar of dirt. 
Scene: Longboat
[Pintel and Ragetti are rowing a longboat with key members of the crew inside]
[Jack in the bow, Elizabeth and Norrington are in the back]
PINTEL: You're pullin' too fast.
RAGETTI: You're pulling too slow. We don't want the Kraken to catch us.
PINTEL: I'm savin' me strength for when it comes. And I don't think it's Krack-en, anyways. I always heard it said Kray-kin. 
RAGETTI: What, with a long A? 
PINTEL: Aye.
RAGETTI: No-no-no-no-no-no-no. Krock-en's how it's pronounced in the original Scandinavian, and Krack-en's closer to that. 
PINTEL: Well we ain't original Scandinavians, are we? Kray-ken!
RAGETTI: It's a mythological creature, I can calls it what I wants.
ISLA CRUCES: beach
[their longboat arrives at the beach, Jack disembarks and begins to walk off]
JACK SPARROW: Guard the boat, mind the tide... Don't touch my dirt.
[Elizabeth is walking in some sand dunes near the beach, using the compass]
ELIZABETH SWANN: This doesn't work. And it *certainly* doesn't show you what you want most.
[Elizabeth sits down on the sand, and sets the compass down on the sand, the needle points to her]
JACK SPARROW: Yes it *does*. You're sitting on it! 
ELIZABETH SWANN: Beg your pardon?
JACK SPARROW: Move. 
[they start digging under where Elizabeth was sitting]
[Pintel and Ragetti are by the boat, clowning around, Ragetti is balancing a shovel on one hand]
PINTEL: "Mind the tide." 
RAGETTI: I can/may join the circus!
PINTEL: Don't mind if I shine your shoes, Sir?
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
[Jones is watching Pintel and Ragetti on the beach through a spyglass]
DAVY JONES: They're here. And I cannot step foot on land again for near of a decade. 
MACCUS: Then trust us to act in your stead.
DAVY JONES: I'll trust you know what awaits should you *fail*! Down, then!
[ugly, nondescript crewmember] Down!
MACCUS: Down!
[view from the deck of the Flying Dutchman as it submerges, some underwater footage]
[Pintel and Ragetti are astounded to see the ship submerge in the distance, Ragetti's balanced shovel falls]
[Pintel and Ragetti run off to warn the others]
Scene: ###!
ISLA CRUCES: beach
[Norrington is digging in the sand, Jack sits in a lotus position nearby on a sandy slope] 
[while digging, Norrington's shovel hits something hard, they brush off sand to reveal a chest]
[they remove the chest from the sand]
[the chest contains a pearl necklace, documents, and a smaller chest, among other things]
[Elizabeth opens up a letter with a wax seal, and reads it to herself]
[they all bend near to put their ears to the small chest, and they hear a heartbeat]
ELIZABETH SWANN: It's real!
NORRINGTON: You actually *were* telling the truth.
JACK SPARROW: I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.
WILL TURNER: With good reason!
[Will has unexpectedly appeared on the beach, walking up toward them] 
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will! You're alright! Thank God! I came to find you!
[Will and Elizabeth kiss]
JACK SPARROW: How did you get here?
WILL TURNER: Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them, strapped to my feet.
JACK SPARROW: Not so easy, is it?
WILL TURNER: But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
JACK SPARROW: You do?
WILL TURNER: After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones.
ELIZABETH SWANN: What?
JACK SPARROW: What?
WILL TURNER: I was reunited with my father.
JACK SPARROW: Oh! Well... you're welcome, then.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Everything you said to me... every word, was a lie!
JACK SPARROW: Pretty much. Time and tide, love. 
[Will stoops down with the key to open the chest]
JACK SPARROW: Oy! What're you doing?
WILL TURNER: I'm gonna kill Jones.
[Jack draws his sword, points it at Will]
JACK SPARROW: Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. If you please: The key.
[Will backs up slowly, then suddenly draws Elizabeth's sword, points it at Jack]
WILL TURNER: I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.
[Norrington draws his sword, points it at Will]
NORRINGTON: I can't let you do that, either. So sorry.
JACK SPARROW: I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
[Norrington points his sword at Jack]
NORRINGTON: Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, and get my life back.
JACK SPARROW: Ah. The dark side of ambition.
NORRINGTON: Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Stop it! Be careful!
[various dueling interjections]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack!
WILL TURNER: Guard the chest!
[duel halts for a second]
ELIZABETH SWANN: *No*!
[duel resumes]
ELIZABETH SWANN: This is bar-*baric*! This is *no* way for grown men to settle - ! Oh! Fine! Let's just - *pull* out our swords and start *banging* away at each other! *This will solve everything!* I've had it! I've had enough! Wobbly-legged, rum-soaked... *pirates*! 
[Elizabeth throws a rock at the duelists, but the rock goes far to the left of them]
PINTEL: How'd this go all screwy? Enough!
RAGETTI: Well, each wants the chest for hisself, don't 'e? Mister Norrington, I think he's tryna regain a bit of honor. Old Jack's lookin' to trade it, save his own skin. And Turner there - I figure 'e's tryna... settle some unresolved business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father. 
PINTEL: Sad. That chest must be worth more 'n a shiny penny. 
RAGETTI: Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Terrible temptation.
PINTEL: If we was any kind of *decent*, we'd remove temptation from their path.
[Pintel and Ragetti giggle and run off to steal the small chest]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will! *Enough!*
[Elizabeth is panting from exasperation and exhaustion]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh! Oh...! The heat!
[Elizabeth pretends to faint, which knocks off her hat]
[Elizabeth watches sideways as the duelists continue fighting, oblivious to her]
[Elizabeth soon sits up, puts on her hat]
[Pintel & Ragetti run by in the distance behind her, with the chest]
[Elizabeth sees Pintel & Ragetti, and goes to chase them]
[various duel scenes on the beach]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Bugger!
[Norrington kicks sand in Will's face]
NORRINGTON: By your leave, Mister Turner.
[Norrington runs off to chase Jack up the hill]
[the crew of Flying Dutchman emerge from the shallows]
[one crewmember holds chain shot as a weapon]
ISLA CRUCES: church
[Jack and Norrington run through bushes on the beach, then up to a dilapidated stone church on the hill] [P2] 
[Norrington chases Jack up steps inside the building, Jack kicks Norrington back down with his foot] 
[Jack and Norrington have a swordfight on the inside steps]
[Jack grabs hold of the bell rope, which carries him downward, and carries Will upward, who just arrived]
WILL TURNER: By *your* leave, Mister Norrington.
[the Flying Dutchman crew on shore are at the large chest and look up to the ringing bell in the building on the hill]
[while Norrington and Will are dueling on top of the roof, Jack deftly grabs the dangling key away from Norrington's hand]
[noticing the key gone, Norrington then turns and duels with Jack]
[soon Norrington knocks Jack's sword from Jack's hand, the sword is flung onto the ground below]
NORRINGTON: Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.
WILL TURNER: Be my guest.
JACK SPARROW: Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?
NORRINGTON: Enough!
[Jack somersaults off the roof to escape, Norrington turns to Will]
NORRINGTON: Unfortunately, Mister Turner... He's *right*!
[Norrington and Will resume their part of the rooftop duel]
JACK SPARROW: Still rooting for you, mate!
[Jack picks up his sword from the ground, and puts the key around his neck]
[Jack walks through a graveyard, falls into an open grave] 
JACK SPARROW: Wup!
[Jack stands up in the bottom of the hole]
JACK SPARROW: Oh.
[Norrington backs Will onto the top of the mill's waterwheel]
[the axle of the wheel breaks off with Norrington and Jack dueling on top]
[Jack is facing the other direction, so is unaware of the freed wheel rolling behind him]
[the wheel crashes through a small fence, turns, and rolls directly towards Jack]
[the waterwheel rolls over Jack, and Jack is pulled into the inside of the wheel]
JACK SPARROW: Woah!
[the key that Jack had around his neck falls off into the wheel]
[Jack struggles to grab the key, which is caught and dangling inside the rolling wheel]
[Jack finally grabs the key, but hits his head on a metal bar inside the wheel, and falls off the wheel] 
[Pintel & Ragetti are running off with the small chest, each holding one side, giggling]
[Elizabeth steps in front Pintel & Ragetti, confronting them, halts, panting]
[Pintel & Ragetti drop the chest, pull their swords on Elizabeth]
[Elizabeth reaches for her sword, but it's gone] 
PINTEL: 'Ello, Poppet.
[Pintel & Ragetti slowly advance on Elizabeth, she slowly retreats while facing them]
[they all pause for a moment to watch the wheel roll by with the duel on top]
[Jack is running behind the wheel, trying to catch up and get the key that is still inside]
[Pintel shrugs, Pintel and Ragetti resume advancing on Elizabeth]
[suddenly a thrown axe embeds itself in a coconut palm next to Elizabeth]
[all three turn to see Jones' crew crashing through the bushes toward them]
[swordfight ensues with the Flying Dutchmen crew and Pintel and Ragetti]
[Norrington and Will continue fighting atop the rolling wheel]
[Jack grabs hold of a palm frond on a coconut palm while at the top of the wheel]
[the wheel continues on, Jack hangs from the frond, then drops to the ground]
PINTEL: Sword!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Sword!
[a sword is thrown to Elizabeth, just in time]
PINTEL: Sword!
[a sword is thrown to Pintel, just in time]
RAGETTI: Sword!
[a sword is thrown to Ragetti, just in time]
[Jack sees Hadrus running alone through the palms, carrying the small chest]
[Jack picks up a coconut, whirls it a moment, then throws it at Hadrus]
[Hadrus' (conch shell) head is knocked off by the coconut]
[Hadrus' head lies on the ground, attempting to give orders to the rest of his body to find the head]
HADRUS: Aya! Uh seech! Aunido! Aunido! Follow my voice! Follow my voice! To the left, uh... No, to the right... Go to the left... 
[Hadrus' headless body walks into a coconut palm]
HADRUS: No... That's a tree.
JACK SPARROW: Oh, shut it.
[Jack unlocks the small chest with the key, square security bolts suddenly protrude when opened]
[the heart is inside, beating]
[crewmen of the Flying Dutchman approach, Jack tucks the heart into his vest]
[Elizabeth uses two swords together, one in each hand, to stab backwards and kill two attacking crewmen]
ISLA CRUCES: beach
[Jack is the first to arrive back at the longboat on the beach]
JACK SPARROW: Jar of dirt!
[Jack opens his jar of dirt, dumps out some dirt, puts the heart in the jar, scoops handfuls of dirt back into the jar]
[a Flying Dutchman crewmember arrives at the boat, Jack fights him using an oar]
[the swordfight is carried to the beach as the Black Pearl crew attempts to escape by longboat]
[Norrington arrives at the longboat, while others are fighting he takes the heart from the jar, puts it under his vest]
[the rolling waterwheel reaches the beach, rolls out into the shallows, falls on its side]
[Norrington and Will walk away from it, wobbling from dizziness]
WILL TURNER: Right!
[Pintel & Ragetti attempt to escape by longboat, but Will blocks their progress]
[Pintel & Ragetti reach for their swords, to find their swords gone]
[Pintel & Ragetti grab a fishnet and oar as weapons against Will]
PINTEL: Come on, Turner!
[Jack fights with Koleniko, using an oar, subdues him]
[Will sees the key in the chest, Jack notices Will looking at the key and chest]
[Jack hits Will on the head with the our, which knocks him out]
JACK SPARROW: Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with.
ELIZABETH SWANN: We're not getting out of this.
NORRINGTON: Not with the chest. Into the boat. 
[Norrington takes the chest]
ELIZABETH SWANN: You're mad.
NORRINGTON: Don't wait for me.
JACK SPARROW: Uh, I say we respect his final wish.
PINTEL: Aye! 
[the remaining Black Pearl crew escape by longboat]
[Hadrus is holding his conch shell head under one arm, the head speaks to Norrington]
HADRUS: Your bravery is wasted. I shall pry the chest away from your cold... dead... hands.
[Norrington pauses, looks around]
NORRINGTON: Here you go! 
HADRUS: Oo!
[Norrington flees, Hadrus drops his head onto the ground when catching the chest]
[Hadrus' crewmates laugh and walk off with Hadrus' body, ignoring Hadrus' head]
HADRUS: Uh! Ando! Aunido! Aunido! Pirates!
[the face inside Hadrus' head turns around, turns into a hermit crab, extends its legs]
[the hermit crab head crawls after its departing body and crew]
HADRUS: Vengo kowmpenay lachay. Hey! Hovaya! Black Pearl
[Will, lying flat on the deck, head over a grate, returns to consciousness aboard the Black Pearl]
WILL TURNER: What happened to the chest?
ELIZABETH SWANN: Norrington took it to draw them off.
PINTEL: You're pulling too hard!
RAGETTI: You're not pulling hard enough!
GIBBS: Where's the Commodore?
JACK SPARROW: He fell behind.
GIBBS: My prayers be with him. Best not wallow in our grief. The bright side is: You're back. And made it off free and clear.
[the Flying Dutchman suddenly surfaces alongside them]
GIBBS: Lord almighty.us.
JACK SPARROW: I'll handle this, mate.
JACK SPARROW: Hey! Fishface! Lose something? Hey? Oup!
[Jack falls down the stairs of the Pearl, crew says "Ooh!"]
JACK SPARROW: Got it! 
[Jack stands up, struts across the deck, holding his jar of dirt]
JACK SPARROW: Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git? Look what I got. I got a jar of dirt! I got a jar of dirt! And guess what's inside it?
DAVY JONES: Enough!
[the Flying Dutchman's cannon covers slide down, cannons emerge from the holes]
JACK SPARROW: Hard to starboard.
ELIZABETH SWANN: *Hard to starboard!*
WILL TURNER: Brace up the foreyard! 
GIBBS: Hard to starboard!
DAVY JONES: Send his beloved Pearl back to the depths! Fire!
[a heavy cannonade fires from the Flying Dutchman, blowing large holes in the Black Pearl]
[Pintel and Ragetti look through the gaping hole in the stern, see the Flying Dutchman following them]
PINTEL: She's on us! She's on us!
DAVY JONES: Let them taste the triple guns.
[cage-faced crewmember] Aye, Captain.
[triple-barreled cannon fires, barrel rotates after each blast] 
DAVY JONES: Come on, ###!
ELIZABETH SWANN: She's falling behind!
GIBBS: Aye, and we've got her!
WILL TURNER: We're the faster?
GIBBS: Against the wind the Dutchman beats us. That's how she takes her prey. But *with* the wind...
WILL TURNER: We rob her advantage.
GIBBS: Ah!
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
DAVY JONES: They're out of range! Break out run ### We giving up, Sir?
[crewmen of the Flying Dutchman are whipped to raise the Kraken calling device]
Scene: BLACK PEARL
MARTY: They're giving up! Yay!
[crew cheers]
WILL TURNER: My father is *on* that ship. If we can outrun her, we can take her. We should turn and fight. 
JACK SPARROW: Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs... is the proper leverage.
[suddenly the Black Pearl is badly jarred]
[Jack's jar of dirt falls to the deck, breaks open, spills all the dirt]
[Jack runs down to the spilled dirt, searches frantically for the heart, which is gone]
JACK SPARROW: Where is it? Where is the thump-thump? We must've hit the reef! 
WILL TURNER: No. It's not a reef! Get away from the rail!
ELIZABETH SWANN: What is it?
WILL TURNER: The Kraken. To arms!
GIBBS: All guns, defend the masts! 
WILL TURNER: It'll attack the starboard. I've seen it before. Break out the cannons and hold for my signal. 
[with a deep rumbling sound, the Kraken's tentacles slowly crawl up the hull]
WILL TURNER: Easy, boys!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will?
[the tentacles rise higher]
WILL TURNER: Steady! Steady.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will?
[the tentacles start feeling around the ship]
WILL TURNER: Hold. Hold...
PINTEL: I think we've held fire long enough.
ELIZABETH SWANN: *Will?*
WILL TURNER: *Fire...*!
[the crew fire the cannons, hitting the tentacles and nearly severing some]
[the Kraken sinks into the sea, some tentacles glowing from the blast]
[the crew cheers]
WILL TURNER: It'll be back. We have to get off the ship.
ELIZABETH SWANN: There's no boats.
[Will sees the wrecked boats, then sets his eyes on the barrels of gunpowder]
WILL TURNER: Pull the grates! Get all the gunpowder onto the net in the cargo hold.
[hands Elizabeth a long gun]
WILL TURNER: Whatever you do, don't miss.
ELIZABETH SWANN: As soon as you're clear.
[the crew is busy loading barrels of gunpowder from the hold] We are short stocked on gunpowder. Six barrel/below.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Bring it up!
GIBBS: There's only half a dozen kegs of powder!
WILL TURNER: Then load the rum!
[Gibbs seems shocked, then turns to see the entire crew halted, staring at him in shocked silence]
GIBBS: Aye! The rum, too!
[the crew continues loading]
[aerial view approaching Black Pearl, zooming through the rigging to the other side]
[Jack is in a rowboat alone, rowing away from the Black Pearl]
[Jack stops rowing, sees the Kraken with tentacles around Black Pearl in the distance]
[Jack looks back into the direction he's headed, then consults his Compass]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Step to!
[Elizabeth runs to the railing, sees Jack rowing away]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh you coward!
[another heavy thud hits the ship, crewmen shout]
MARTY: Not good.
[the Kraken attacks again]
WILL TURNER: Pull away!
GIBBS: Heave! Heave like you're being paid for it!
[Pintel & Ragetti stand to one side of a cannon port as a tentacle pulls one crewmember through sideways]
[Will hangs onto the side of the net of gunpowder barrels, attempting to attract the Kraken's attention]
WILL TURNER: Euh! Come on!I'm over here! Come on!
[Will slashes at tentacles with his sword]
WILL TURNER: Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!
[Elizabeth hesitates, waiting for Will to fall free]
[one of the Kraken's tentacles wrap around her leg and drag her backwards, she screams]
[Ragetti chops off the end of the tentacle holding Elizabeth]
[Another crewmember picks up the rifle and attempts to shoot, only to be grabbed by the Kraken and flung around]
[the rifle drops onto the deck above Elizabeth]
[Elizabeth tries to pick up the fallen rifle, but someone's foot holds it down]
[she sees that it's Jack's foot, that he has returned to the Pearl]
[Jack picks up the rifle and takes aim at the gunpowder]
[slow motion scene of Jack firing a ball into the gunpowder]
[ball whistles through the air, strikes the gunpowder, which explodes]
[the Kraken releases its hold, burned tentacles withdraw into the ocean, groaning sound]
MARTY: Did we kill it?
GIBBS: No. We just made it angry. We're not out of this yet. Captain! Orders!
JACK SPARROW: Abandon ship. Into the longboat.
GIBBS: Jack! The Pearl!
JACK SPARROW: She's only a ship, mate.
ELIZABETH SWANN: He's right, we have to head for land.
PINTEL: 'S a lot o' open wa'er.
RAGETTI: That's a lot o' wa'er.
WILL TURNER: We have to try. We can get away as it takes down the Pearl.
GIBBS: Abandon ship. Abandon ship or abandon hope.
[the crew get ready to leave the Pearl, loading supplies and guns]
[Elizabeth approaches Jack]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Thank you, Jack.
JACK SPARROW: We're not free yet, love.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You came back. I always knew you were a good man.
[Elizabeth passionately kisses Jack] 
[Will sees the kiss from the longboat, falters]
GIBBS: Prepare to cast off! There's no time to lose! Come on, Will, step to!
[the kiss is inturrupted by the sound of shackles, Elizabeth has chained Jack to the main mast]
ELIZABETH SWANN: It's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see? I'm not sorry.
[Elizabeth leans in as if to kiss him again.]
JACK SPARROW: Pirate. 
[Elizabeth leaves Jack and climbs down into the long boat]
WILL TURNER: Where's Jack?
ELIZABETH SWANN: He elected to stay behind to give us a chance.
[the crew look uncertain]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Go!
[the longboat casts off]
[Jack struggles with his manacles]
JACK SPARROW: Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger...!
[a coconut and cannonball roll by, on the tilted deck]
[Jack spots a fallen lantern, picks it up with the tip of his sword]
[Jack breaks the lantern against the mast, pours oil over his wrists]
[Jack struggles with slipping his hand out]
JACK SPARROW: Come on... Come on...
[Jack finally manages to slip his hands out]
[the Kraken rises up behind him]
[Jack halts, turns around, faces the Kraken]
[music and sound stop momentarily]
[the Kraken roars, spraying Jack with slime and flinging his earlier-eaten hat to the deck]
JACK SPARROW: Not so bad.
[Jack spots his old hat lying next to his feet]
JACK SPARROW: Oh!
[Jack spots his hat, picks it up, puts it on, wipes slime from his face]
JACK SPARROW: Hello, beastie.
[slow motion scene of Jack boldy charging toward the Kraken's mouth, sword drawn] [Q3] 
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
DAVY JONES: Jack Sparrow. Our debt is settled. 
KOLENIKO: The captain goes down with his ship.
MACCUS: Turns out not even Jack Sparrow can best the devil.
DAVY JONES: Open the chest. Open the chest, I need to see it!
[the chest is opened, side view as Jones looks in, his face quivers]
[downwards view, showing that the chest is empty, Jones tilts his head back and shouts]
DAVY JONES: Damn you, Jack Spar-*row*!
PORT ROYAL: EITC headquarters
MERCER: The last of our ships has returned.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Is there any news on the chest?
MERCER: None. But... one of the ships did pick up a man adrift at sea. He had these.
[Mercer drops the Letters of Marque on Beckett's desk]
[Beckett opens the letter to look at it before looking up at Norrington, who has been standing in the office] 
NORRINGTON: I took the liberty of filling in my name.
[from his desk, Beckett beckons Norrington with two fingers]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: If you intend to claim these, then you must have something to trade. D'you have the Compass?
NORRINGTON: Better. The heart of Davy Jones.
BAYOU: Tia's shack
[the remaining crew paddles through the waters to Tia Dalma's shack] 
[many natives stand in the waters surrounding the shack, holding candles, mourning Jack Sparrow]
[inside the shack, Will absent-mindedly keeps throwing his father's knife into the table top]
[Tia carries a tray around to all of them, offers the mugs to Elizabeth]
TIA DALMA: Against de cold... and de sorrow.
[Elizabeth takes a mug but doesn't drink] 
TIA DALMA: It's a shame. I know you're t'inking that wid the Pearl, you coulda captured the devil and set free your fadder's soul.
WILL TURNER: Doesn't matter now. The Pearl's gone. Along with its captain.
[Gibbs is standing in the doorway on the side of the shack]
GIBBS: Aye. And already the world seems a bit less bright. He fooled us all right to the end. But I guess that honest streak finally won out. To Jack Sparrow!
RAGETTI: Never another like Captain Jack.
PINTEL: He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.
ELIZABETH SWANN: He was a good man.
[they all take a drink out of their mugs, except Elizabeth]
WILL TURNER: If there was anything could be done to bring him back... Elizabeth...
TIA DALMA: Would you do it? Hmmm? What... would you? Hmmm? What would *any* of you be willing to do? Hmmm? Would you sail to the ends of the eart', and beyond, to fetch back witty Jack and 'im precious Pearl? 
GIBBS: Aye.
PINTEL: Aye.
RAGETTI: Aye.
COTTON'S PARROT: Awk! Aye.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Yes.
WILL TURNER: Aye.
TIA DALMA: Alright. But if you're goin' brave de weird, and haunted shores, at world's end, den... you will need a captain who knows dose waters. 
[a man wearing boots descends the stairs into the room]
BARBOSSA: So tell me, what's become of my ship? 
[Barbossa bites into a green apple, juice dripples down his chin]
[Jack the monkey on Barbossa's left shoulder faces the camera and snarls]
